**[HERO]**

### I audited 8 Google Ads accounts in 10 minutes. From my terminal.

25 campaigns. 30+ ads. RSA best practices, sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets. Claude found the gaps, suggested fixes, and made the changes itself.

I don't know how to code.

**[ORIGIN]**

A year ago I was clicking through the Google Ads UI like everyone else. Slow. Tedious. Managing 25+ accounts meant living inside dashboards I hated.

Then I started experimenting with Claude.

Not as a chatbot. As a coworker.

First Claude 3.5 Haiku. Then Sonnet. Now I run Claude Opus 4.5 in my terminal every day. Somewhere along the way, "experimenting with AI" became "I produce 10,000 lines of code daily and I still couldn't write a for-loop from scratch."

I built an MCP server. Claude built most of it, honestly. Now my media buying happens in the terminal. It's faster. It's more fun. I actually enjoy the work again.

**[THE BUILD]**

I'm building an open source marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Specifically for media buyers like me.

Everything is free. You just need a Claude Pro subscription (around $20/month).

Why free? Two reasons.

First, I want your feedback. These tools get better when people actually use them and tell me what's broken, what's missing, what would make their work easier.

Second, I think open source is how this should work. Intelligence is becoming a commodity. The value is in knowing how to use it. That's what I'm sharing.

**[PROOF]**

Here's what 10 minutes looks like now:

I asked Claude to audit 8 client accounts for RSA best practices. It scanned 25 campaigns. Checked 30+ ads for callouts, sitelinks, structured snippets. Found the gaps. Suggested specific assets to fill them. Then made the changes.

All from the terminal. While I had coffee.

This is where media buying is going. I'm just getting there early and documenting the path.

**[THE BELIEF]**

Right now, the focus is media buying. That's where I live every day.

Later, maybe this expands. Design. Analytics. Creative. I'm not sure yet.

I'm not an expert on these tools. But I am a daily practitioner. Someone who optimizes systems because I can't help myself. Someone who'd rather spend an hour automating a task than do it manually twice.

If that sounds like you, we should probably be in touch.

**[INVITATION]**

**Join the list.**

You'll get first access to plugins as I release them. Updates on what's working (and what isn't). No pitch decks. No courses to sell. Just tools and honest notes from someone figuring this out in public.

**[CTA: Get early access →]**

*I send emails when I have something worth sharing. Usually 1-2x per month.*

## Implementation Notes

**Headline options (test these):**
- "I audited 8 Google Ads accounts in 10 minutes. From my terminal."
- "I manage 25+ Google Ads accounts from my terminal. I still can't code."
- "10,000 lines of code a day. Zero coding knowledge. Here's how."

**CTA button options:**
- "Join the list"
- "Get early access"
- "Follow the build"

**What to show after signup:**
Brief confirmation: "You're in. First plugin drops [timeframe]. I'll email you when it's ready."

**Social proof to add when available:**
- Number of accounts/campaigns managed with the tools
- Specific time savings (before/after)
- Quotes from beta users once you have them

## Design Guidance

- Keep it single-column, readable
- No stock photos. Screenshots of the terminal in action would work if you have them.
- The 10-minute audit story is your strongest proof point. Consider making it visually distinct.
- Mobile-first. Media buyers check email on phones.
