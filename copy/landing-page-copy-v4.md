**[HERO]**

### 10,000 lines of code a day. I don't know how to code.

That sounds impossible until you see what Claude can do when you stop treating it like a chatbot.

I audited 8 Google Ads accounts last week. 25 campaigns. 30+ ads. RSA compliance, sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets. Claude found the gaps, wrote the fixes, pushed the changes.

Ten minutes. From my terminal. While I drank my coffee.

**[ORIGIN]**

A year ago I lived inside the Google Ads UI. Twenty-five accounts. Hundreds of campaigns. The same checks, over and over, in dashboards that made me hate the work.

Then I started experimenting with Claude.

Not for ads at first. I was curious what it could do. I asked it to pull some data. It wrote a script. I asked for another. That worked too.

I kept asking. It kept building.

Somewhere along the way I stopped thinking of Claude as a tool and started thinking of it as the junior developer I could never afford. One who writes thousands of lines of code while I describe what I need in plain English.

Now my workflow lives in the terminal. That probably sounds intimidating if you've never used one. It's not. It's a text window. You type what you want. Claude does the rest.

I built a system that gives Claude direct access to my ad accounts. Claude built most of it. Now I manage everything from one place. It's faster. It's cleaner. For the first time in years, I actually enjoy the work.

**[THE BUILD]**

I'm turning what I built into something you can use.

An open source marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Think of them as tools that let Claude work directly with your ad accounts, your data, your workflows.

Built for media buyers. Everything free.

You need a Claude Pro subscription. Around $20 a month. That's it.

**Why give it away?**

I don't need your money. I need your feedback.

Use these tools. Break them. Tell me what's broken, what's missing, what would make your work easier. That's how they get better. That's the deal.

**What about my accounts?**

Fair question. These plugins read your data and can make changes, but only when you ask. Claude shows you what it's about to do and waits for your approval. You stay in control.

**[THE BELIEF]**

Intelligence is becoming a commodity. Anyone can access Claude for $20 a month. What matters now is the workflows. The prompts. The patterns that produce results.

The tools are free. The real value is knowing how to wield them.

Right now, the focus is media buying. That's where I live every day.

Later? Design. Analytics. Creative. I don't know yet.

I'm not an expert on these tools. I'm a daily practitioner. Someone who optimizes systems because I can't help myself. Someone who'd rather spend an hour automating a task than do it twice.

If you can describe what you want in a sentence, you can use these tools.

If that sounds like you, we should talk.

**[INVITATION]**

**Join the list.**

First access to every plugin I ship. Notes on what's working and what isn't. No pitch decks. No courses. Tools and honest notes from someone building in public.

*I email when I have something worth saying. Once or twice a month.*

## Revision Notes (V4)

### What changed from V3

**1. Headline restructure**
Led with the paradox ("10,000 lines of code / don't know how to code") instead of the audit stat. The paradox creates intrigue. The audit stat is now proof that follows.

**2. Added the fear objection**
New beat: "What about my accounts?" addresses the unspoken worry that AI could break something. Explains the approval flow. Lowers friction without being defensive.

**3. Widened the audience**
Removed "25 accounts" from the hero. That number signals agency scale and might exclude in-house marketers managing fewer accounts. The proof section still shows scope without gatekeeping.

**4. Strengthened the exchange**
"I don't need your money. I need your feedback." is now its own beat with a line break. The exchange is the offer. It deserves emphasis.

**5. Softened "terminal" intimidation**
Added: "That probably sounds intimidating if you've never used one. It's not. It's a text window. You type what you want. Claude does the rest." Meets the AI-hesitant audience where they are.

**6. Removed remaining cruft**
- Eliminated "honestly" (V1 leftover)
- Cut "maybe" hedges
- Removed all em dashes
- Kept the clean V3 structure

### Headline test variants

Primary (V4): "10,000 lines of code a day. I don't know how to code."

Alternates to test:
- "I audited 8 Google Ads accounts in 10 minutes. I don't know how to code."
- "The junior developer I couldn't afford writes 10,000 lines of code a day."
- "I manage 25 ad accounts from my terminal. I still can't write a for-loop."

### Section flow

1. **Hero** — Paradox hook + proof snippet + CTA
2. **Origin** — How I got here (compressed journey)
3. **The Build** — What exists + why it's free + safety objection
4. **The Belief** — Worldview + who this is for
5. **Invitation** — Clear ask + what they get + frequency

### Anti-pattern checklist

- [x] No em dashes
- [x] No banned phrases (unlock, leverage, game-changer, etc.)
- [x] No performative vulnerability
- [x] Numbers have context
- [x] Story has clear invitation
- [x] Single CTA (email signup)
- [x] Philosophy backed by specific example (the audit)
- [x] Read aloud test: sounds like talking, not performing

### Design notes

- Single column, mobile-first
- Terminal screenshot would strengthen the hero if available
- Consider animating the "10,000 lines" number on scroll
- The "What about my accounts?" section could be a collapsible FAQ if the page feels long

### Post-signup flow

Confirmation: "You're in. First plugin drops soon. I'll email you when it's ready."

Consider a welcome email that:
1. Sets expectations (what they'll receive, how often)
2. Asks one question ("What's your biggest Google Ads headache?")
3. Delivers immediate value (link to the first tool or a preview)
