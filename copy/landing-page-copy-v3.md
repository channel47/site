**[HERO]**

### I audited 8 Google Ads accounts in 10 minutes. From my terminal.

25 campaigns. 30+ ads. RSA compliance, sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets. Claude found the gaps, wrote the fixes, pushed the changes.

I don't know how to code.

**[ORIGIN]**

A year ago I lived inside the Google Ads UI. Twenty-five accounts. Hundreds of campaigns. The same checks, over and over, in dashboards that made me hate the work.

Then I started experimenting with Claude.

Not for ads, at first. Curious what it could do. I asked it to pull some data. It wrote a script. I asked for another. That worked too.

I kept asking. It kept building.

I stopped treating Claude like a chatbot. Started treating it like the junior dev I could never afford. One who writes 10,000 lines of code a day while I tell it what I need in plain English.

Now my workflow lives in the terminal. It's simpler than it sounds. A text window. You type what you want. Claude does the rest.

I built a system that gives Claude direct access to my ad accounts. Claude built most of it. Now I manage everything from one place. It's faster. It's cleaner. For the first time in years, I enjoy the work.

**[THE BUILD]**

I'm turning what I built into something you can use.

An open source marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Think of them as tools that let Claude work directly with your ad accounts, your data, your workflows.

Built for media buyers. Everything free.

You need a Claude Pro subscription. Around $20 a month. That's it.

Why give it away? I don't need your money. I need your feedback.

Use these tools. Break them. Tell me what's missing. That's how they get better. That's the deal.

Intelligence is becoming a commodity. Anyone can access Claude. What matters now is the workflows. The prompts. The patterns that produce results.

The tools are free. The real value is knowing how to wield them.

**[THE BELIEF]**

Right now, the focus is media buying. That's where I live.

Later? Design. Analytics. Creative. I don't know yet.

I'm not an expert on these tools. I'm a daily practitioner. Someone who optimizes systems because I can't help myself. Someone who'd rather spend an hour automating a task than do it twice.

If you can describe what you want in a sentence, you can use these tools.

If that sounds like you, we should talk.

**[INVITATION]**

**Join the list.**

First access to every plugin I ship. Notes on what's working and what isn't. No pitch decks. No courses. Tools and notes from someone building in public.

**[CTA: Get early access →]**

*I email when I have something worth saying. Once or twice a month.*

## Revision Notes

### Sources
- V1: Original structured copy with clear sections
- V2: Flowing narrative with "10,000 lines" hook

### Key Decisions

**From V1:**
- Section structure (Hero, Origin, Build, Belief, Invitation)
- Proof-first headline (8 accounts, 10 minutes)
- "I don't know how to code" as kicker
- Clear CTA placement

**From V2:**
- "10,000 lines of code" hook (moved to Origin)
- "Stop thinking of it as a chatbot" reframe (adapted)
- More explicit exchange language ("Break them. Tell me what's missing.")

**New in V3:**
- Removed all em dashes
- Removed adverbs (honestly, actually, just, maybe)
- Added technical term explanations without being condescending
- Replaced "MCP server" with plain-language equivalent
- Added "Claude Code plugins" explanation on first use
- Added accessibility beat: "If you can describe what you want in a sentence, you can use these tools."
- Added seed for future paid offer: "The tools are free. The real value is knowing how to wield them."

### Technical Terms Addressed

| Term | Solution |
|------|----------|
| "From my terminal" | Kept for intrigue; explained in Origin section |
| "MCP server" | Replaced with "a system that gives Claude direct access to my ad accounts" |
| "Claude Code plugins" | Explained immediately: "tools that let Claude work directly with your ad accounts" |
| "10,000 lines of code" | Kept; neutralized by "in plain English" in same sentence |

### Funnel Strategy

Landing page leads with free plugins (tangible, specific proof). Seeds the knowledge angle with "The tools are free. The real value is knowing how to wield them." Paid training offer introduced later in email flow after trust is established.
