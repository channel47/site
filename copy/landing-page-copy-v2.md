Mode: Founder Journey (Open Source / Community)
Core belief: Intelligence is a commodity. Knowing how to wield it is the product.
Invitation: Join a community of media buyers learning to work with AI tools.

I produce about 10,000 lines of code a day. I don't know how to code.
That sounds like a contradiction until you understand what Claude can do when you stop thinking of it as a chatbot.

A year ago I was clicking through the Google Ads UI like everyone else. Twenty-five accounts. Hundreds of campaigns. The same repetitive checks, day after day.
Then I started experimenting with Claude. Not for ads specifically. Just curious what it could do. I asked it to write a script that would pull campaign data. It worked. I asked for another. That worked too.
Within a few months, I'd moved my entire workflow into the terminal. I built an MCP server that lets me manage all twenty-five accounts from one place. I still don't know how to code in any traditional sense. Claude writes it. I direct it.

Here's what that looks like in practice.
Last week I asked Claude to audit eight accounts. Check every campaign, every ad, every extension against RSA best practices. Find the gaps. Suggest the fixes. Make the changes.
It took under ten minutes. That same task used to take me a full day, and I'd still miss things.

Now I'm building something bigger. An open source marketplace for Claude Code plugins built specifically for media buyers.
The first plugin is the Google Ads MCP server I built for myself. More are coming. All free.
Why free? Because the value for me isn't in selling tools. It's in you using them.

I think intelligence is becoming a commodity. Maybe it already is.
What's valuable now isn't access to AI. It's knowing how to wield it. The workflows, the prompts, the patterns that actually produce results.
That's what this marketplace is about. Not just tools, but the knowledge that makes them useful.
Right now, the focus is media buying. That's where I live. Later, maybe it expands. Design, analysis, creative. I don't know yet. I'm figuring it out as I go.
I'm not an expert on these tools. I'm a daily practitioner. A curious person with a knack for optimizing systems. That's all.

If any of this resonates, I'd like you to join us.
You'll get access to every plugin I build, plus updates on what I'm learning along the way.
What I get is your honest feedback. Use the tools. Break them. Tell me what's missing. That's how they get better.

You'll get an email when new tools drop. That's it. No spam.
