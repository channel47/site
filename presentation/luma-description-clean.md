🎟 Mentor Session Alert!

Everyone's talking about AI agents and automation, but most marketers still don't know how to actually extend what Claude can do. Skills are the missing piece, and they're simpler than you think (just folders with files, no code required).

In this mentor session, Jackson Dean, performance marketer at 4AM Media, walks through the entire AI capability ecosystem and shows you exactly how to build custom skills that fit your workflow.

This is a hands-on, practical walkthrough. Jackson starts by mapping where skills fit in the broader ecosystem, then breaks down what skills actually are under the hood. From there, he builds a skill live with the audience, then runs three live demos of real workflows he uses every week.

⏳ Session Flow
This session is designed so you can follow it end to end or jump straight to the parts that matter most to you.

The Ecosystem ⏱️ 0:00 – 0:10 | MCP, sub-agents, skills. Different tools, different jobs.

What Skills Are ⏱️ 0:10 – 0:25 | The SKILL.md format. How skills load. Why the description makes or breaks it.

Building a Skill (Live) ⏱️ 0:25 – 0:40 | Audience picks a workflow. Claude writes the instructions. We test it. No code.

Live Demos ⏱️ 0:40 – 1:05 | Three real workflows from Jackson's day job and side projects:
01 / Google Search Campaign Architect — landing page URL in, full campaign out
02 / Branded HTML Email Generator — one sentence in, on-brand email out
03 / Ad Creative Refresher — winning ad in, fresh variations out (via Nano Banana Pro)

Safety + Resources ⏱️ 1:05 – 1:10 | Where to find trusted skills. What to check before you install.

Your Takeaway ⏱️ 1:10 – 1:15 | Start with one workflow. Build one skill. Repeat.

Q&A ⏱️ 1:15+ | Open questions from audience

You'll leave with two, packaged up and ready to go skills from the demos. Plus, a guided walkthrough to build your first skill right after the session, and the knowledge to keep building your own.
