00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.689
Ann Marie Almariei: Oh, hello, everyone! Welcome!

2
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.340
jackson: Hello!

3
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.329
Ann Marie Almariei: How's it going, Jackson?

4
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.190
jackson: Fantastic.

5
00:21:50.770 --> 00:22:01.930
Ann Marie Almariei: All right, I'm gonna give it a few minutes for everybody to roll in, and I'm gonna kick out all the note-takers. We're not gonna allow note-takers, in the meeting, we just want it to be

6
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:14.379
Ann Marie Almariei: people who are engaged and, you know, keep it a little bit more personal. And the transcript and replay will be available, in school.

7
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.849
Ann Marie Almariei: So, let me… Let me remove them all.

8
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.840
Léon Dantuma: Excellent!

9
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.690
Ann Marie Almariei: What's up, Tony, good to see ya.

10
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.489
Tony Morinello: Good to see you as well.

11
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.890
Ann Marie Almariei: Happy Thursday! Let's see…

12
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.099
jackson: Hello, Tony, nice to see you, man.

13
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.559
Tony Morinello: Good to see you, Jackson.

14
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.949
jackson: Virtually, in person.

15
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.270
Tony Morinello: Close enough, right?

16
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.260
jackson: Yeah.

17
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.659
Ann Marie Almariei: I'm so excited for this session.

18
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.410
jackson: cat in your profile image, Tony, is… I'm assuming that's a real cat, right?

19
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.360
Tony Morinello: Oh yes, that's one of my five cats, actually.

20
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.830
Ann Marie Almariei: Batman.

21
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.300
Tony Morinello: Yeah, Batman's, like, my, my cat.

22
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.889
Tony Morinello: the other four I share with my wife, but Batman is 100% mine.

23
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.839
jackson: He deserved a spot in the profile photo.

24
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.440
Tony Morinello: Exactly.

25
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.349
Ann Marie Almariei: The last profile photo I did for Tony actually had 5 cats in it.

26
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.219
Tony Morinello: You could probably find it somewhere.

27
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:30.810
Ann Marie Almariei: Somewhere.

28
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:40.340
Ann Marie Almariei: Love seeing some fresh faces on the call, and some who I recognize as well.

29
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:49.170
Ann Marie Almariei: Phil, John, Oad… Tom… Oh, I have too many messages popping up.

30
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.910
Ann Marie Almariei: Welcome, everybody. Jared.

31
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.680
Ann Marie Almariei: Venetius? Is that how I say it? Venetius? Venetius?

32
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.120
Vinícius Custódio - Leads Jurídicos: Yes, yes.

33
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.270
Ann Marie Almariei: Love it.

34
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:15.820
Ann Marie Almariei: Alright, no more note-takers. Tony, can I, hand over host to you, and maybe you can…

35
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.049
Ann Marie Almariei: You can be the note-taker.

36
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.980
Ann Marie Almariei: Police…

37
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.569
Tony Morinello: I thought they'll say I'm not gonna be the cop of the group? Yeah, that's fine.

38
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:37.240
Ann Marie Almariei: I've got most of them, and there is, like, a… there is a tool in Zoom that lets me, like, block some of them, but it doesn't block all of them.

39
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.290
Ann Marie Almariei: Some of them make it through.

40
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.730
Ann Marie Almariei: Alright.

41
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.320
Tony Morinello: Nope.

42
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.659
Tony Morinello: We did this for another, call before, so…

43
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.460
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah, let me see if I can… I can do that.

44
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.390
Ann Marie Almariei: Tony… Let me coast.

45
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.250
Ann Marie Almariei: Okay.

46
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:09.600
Ann Marie Almariei: Alright, why don't we… why don't we get ourselves kind of geared up?

47
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:24.800
Ann Marie Almariei: I'm super excited for this session. We have been going hard on all things Claude recently. Claude code, has really been kind of taking off.

48
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:42.369
Ann Marie Almariei: skills are now this, you know, kind of thing that is revolutionizing how we work with our LLMs. Jackson, volunteered to be our mentor for skills and helping us kind of understand the

49
00:25:42.370 --> 00:26:06.100
Ann Marie Almariei: what they are, how do we use them, how do we build them? We'll actually be building some, today, live. So if, if y'all don't know Jackson, Jackson has been part of our community for a long while. He's been doing some vibe coding and shared some great stories of things that he's been building.

50
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:19.870
Ann Marie Almariei: in the, ecosystem. So, yeah, why don't we, why don't we just kind of kick off, Jackson, with a little introduction? You can say hi, introduce yourselves, and then we can jump right in.

51
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.970
jackson: Sweet. Cool. Well, thank you, and thanks to the Vi Marketing community for hosting this.

52
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:35.860
jackson: really excited to be able to share this stuff. My background, I spent pretty much the bulk of last

53
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:44.619
jackson: Year, on a business that I started in college with friends. That was, like, my full-time-ish job.

54
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.309
jackson: And it was, like, an e-commerce business where

55
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.820
jackson: we leveraged SEO in the beginning, it sort of faltered out, and I turned to coding agents, and as those arrived, like.

56
00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:13.129
jackson: began being popularized. I used those heavily to try to, like, save the business, basically. So I tried a lot of different things. And didn't quite save the business, did enough to keep it on maintenance mode.

57
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.269
jackson: And… learned a lot along the way.

58
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.250
jackson: And so one of the things that recently

59
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:33.410
jackson: was a part of that learnings is this whole skill concept, and how you can use skills across a lot of different AI models. It started in Cloud, and now it's expanding to

60
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:49.329
jackson: other different labs and different products that leverage AI, so it's actually becoming a lot more transferable across products. So if you're not using skills, it's not like you're completely missing out, but they're definitely a

61
00:27:50.150 --> 00:28:02.460
jackson: productivity increaser on top of the already increased productivity that you get from AI. So, I'm gonna try to keep it really base level, but give also some examples of, like, some more advanced

62
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:17.220
jackson: Use cases and skills that we could share throughout this presentation, so that no matter where you are, you'll be able to sort of understand skills at a basic level, and then hopefully have the confidence to go and build your own.

63
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:22.470
jackson: like AMA said, we'll do a build, and you'll see it's like.

64
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:30.790
jackson: It's not rocket science, it's actually quite, quite simple. If you've never done it before, you'll be, I think, quite pleased to see how simple it is.

65
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:51.369
Ann Marie Almariei: And I forgot to tease our big announcement that we're gonna have, at the end. So, for those who are part of the community and tune in, to the ends of the session, we'll be unveiling something that will be kind of starting, kicking off today, but I don't want to spoil the surprise.

66
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:58.110
Ann Marie Almariei: But just wanted to kind of dangle that, so that everybody sticks around for the end. Lots of, lots of goodies.

67
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.200
jackson: Yes.

68
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.830
jackson: So, with that said, should I get started? I think I might.

69
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:22.630
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah, yeah, let's go. We won't have James today. James is on vacation this week, though you wouldn't know it, because he's still shipping, from a boat, which I love. So, we miss you, James. James will catch the replay.

70
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.730
jackson: Sweet! Alright, I'll do my best to get this string.

71
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.159
jackson: And hopefully everyone can see.

72
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.570
jackson: Yep, looks good.

73
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.900
jackson: Yeah, you can see.

74
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.120
Ann Marie Almariei: Yep.

75
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.779
jackson: Oh, fantastic, it worked on first try, alright.

76
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:50.109
jackson: be, working with really advanced technology, but sometimes the most basic technology stumps us the most. So…

77
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:55.519
jackson: without further ado, let's just dive right in. Basically, the format is…

78
00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:03.699
jackson: just, like, a run-through in, sort of, sections, and then we'll have a little bit of Q&A at the end, as well as throughout

79
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.619
jackson: like, when we're building skill, we'll have a time to do some, like, light Q&A there.

80
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.269
jackson: But let's just go right into it. So AI skills, you're basically teaching AI how you work.

81
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.120
jackson: First, before we begin, I'm not an expert.

82
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:37.699
jackson: In fact, I don't really know if anyone is yet. This is only a few months old, skills in particular, but I have been using these daily and, like, in the ecosystem daily, as I'm sure most people have, and so I'll just show you what has been working for me throughout this presentation, and hopefully

83
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:51.550
jackson: you know, it's useful, and if you see something wrong, then feel free to correct me throughout the presentation, but as I said, I'm just showing you as a practitioner to another practitioner what I've been seeing.

84
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.980
jackson: quick.

85
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.650
Ann Marie Almariei: Hey, Jackson, just a…

86
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.180
jackson: Yeah.

87
00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:04.349
Ann Marie Almariei: Just a quick note, because your screen is so wide, it is a little bit small, yeah, so you might want to just zoom in for everybody.

88
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.780
jackson: Is that better?

89
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.510
Ann Marie Almariei: to read.

90
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.780
Ann Marie Almariei: If you go a little… a little more? Yeah, go a little more. If that's good, I think.

91
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.260
jackson: Okay.

92
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:12.800
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah.

93
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.749
jackson: Is that good?

94
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.280
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah, I mean, that's… that's amazing.

95
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:23.879
jackson: Okay, fantastic. Yeah, I had a feeling that that was gonna be small. Sorry, I like small fonts, so if… again, call me out on it.

96
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.060
jackson: So, quickly, Let's just cover the ecosystem.

97
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.169
jackson: And talk about what exists alongside skills.

98
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:47.070
jackson: So basically, there's 3 main tools that I've identified in this ecosystem. We have skills, obviously, which we'll talk about today. There's also MCP servers, and there's also these sub-agents.

99
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.660
jackson: So, what each of these are is…

100
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.739
jackson: They're basically serving a different purpose, each of them.

101
00:31:52.920 --> 00:32:12.610
jackson: Skills you can think of as, like, the playbook, the instructions that AI gets for a specific job. MCP servers you can think of as, like, the connectors, so it connects Claude to things like Slack, to things like Asana, or whatever software that you might be working in. Sub-agents you can think of as, like.

102
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.490
jackson: the… individual workers

103
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:27.949
jackson: that have their own context, and are really great for things like research, and, like, coming up with reports to then give back to whatever main AI that you're talking to.

104
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:46.339
jackson: But these are all, like, independent tools, but they can also all work together. So, like, for example, a skill could define for AI how to use a particular MCP server, and it could also define how to use a sub-agent in the same skill. So you can have skills

105
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.900
jackson: That would leverage both of these things. Which is why this is, like, super…

106
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:58.919
jackson: powerful. When you use them together, it's not necessary to use them together, I'm just mentioning that you can, if you feel like it.

107
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:17.559
jackson: And so, how recent is all this, just to kind of ground us where we are right now? Skills actually launched back in October of last year. Anthropic released the skill-like format, and then in December of last year, they became open standard, meaning

108
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:24.270
jackson: Other AI model labs could begin to adopt the skill.md format that we'll explore today.

109
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.260
jackson: And then, as a result, other…

110
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:34.919
jackson: AI products and labs began picking it up, so it started in Claw Desktop.

111
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:45.929
jackson: and Claude Code, and then Cursor, Codex, Klein, Manis, tons of other apps have now adopted the same, like, format for skills. So a skill that you make

112
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.840
jackson: or that you use in Cloud Desktop.

113
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:54.609
jackson: You can also use in Manus, you can also use in Cursor, or Codex.

114
00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:01.910
jackson: So, it's really helpful to be able to, like, have a refined skill for a workflow that you do.

115
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:19.489
jackson: If you ever wanted to switch apps, or if you have a team member that uses a different, like, product than you, like you use Cloud Desktop, but someone else uses Codex, or vice versa, you could share a skill that you made with them, and they'd still be able to leverage it.

116
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.139
jackson: So, now let's just talk about

117
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.150
jackson: What skills are, like, the quick 60-second version of this.

118
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:37.220
jackson: Basically, a skill is just a markdown file. It's a skill.md file that would…

119
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:48.989
jackson: either live in, like, a project folder that you have on your computer, or if you're using, like, Claude Desktop, they kind of hide the backend of it, and you kind of just have to think about it as

120
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:55.459
jackson: like, and it's in the settings, and we'll actually show where it is, but basically, it's just a Markdown file, so…

121
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:05.959
jackson: If you're using a skill in something like a project folder on your computer, and you're actually looking under the hood at what makes up a skill, you'd have, like, a folder.

122
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.300
jackson: And it'd usually be the name of your skill. In this example, it's just called My Skill.

123
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:24.410
jackson: then you have this skill.md file, which we'll look at after this, and that's the only required element for a skill. You just have to have that skill.md file. This other stuff you see

124
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:40.330
jackson: below this, these are just additional assets, references, and scripts that can be included into a skill, but aren't necessary by default. Those are just optional, depending on the complexity of whatever skill that you are using or building.

125
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:52.929
jackson: So, what a skill.md file looks like, this is basically what it looks like. This is just markdown format, and it's a file that has a quick.

126
00:35:53.660 --> 00:36:07.030
jackson: little front matter section, so a name and a description, and this is what gets loaded by default for whatever AI product or model that you're using with a skill. This is all that they will see.

127
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:17.819
jackson: in the, sort of, like, beginning of a conversation that you have the skill loaded. All this stuff below, like the instructions, that only gets loaded when

128
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:27.259
jackson: the AI deems this relevant to load. And the way it knows to load this skill is from this description. So this description

129
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:42.709
jackson: typically would include something like a use case. So it's like, use when a user says X, or use when a user does Y. The AI is good at knowing when to basically call the skill, but this is all it looks like.

130
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.809
jackson: It's a pretty simple file, and then it just kind of has instructions, input steps, output.

131
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:59.440
jackson: you will not, just a quick note, you will not actually be writing this file unless you want to. If you, like, if you do actually write this file yourself.

132
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:05.589
jackson: I would consider you, like, an artisan, like, someone who really, like, loves

133
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.620
jackson: like, a craft, but you do not need to do this. AI will do this for you, because

134
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.490
jackson: teaser, or spoiler alert, rather, there is a skill to create skills, so…

135
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.269
jackson: I'll show you that throughout, or later in this presentation, but basically, you're just gonna use Claude or whatever.

136
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:31.119
jackson: To create these files for you. So you don't actually have to do, like, hashtag, like, the hashtag, hashtag, input, all that.

137
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.070
jackson: All that business, you can just…

138
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:42.399
jackson: have it done for you. But yeah, to recap, front matter, and then the body. So the front matter, again, is the only part that gets loaded up front.

139
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:50.450
jackson: how they actually work, just repeating what I just said. So, they load basically in 3 different levels.

140
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:55.690
jackson: The front matter is always loaded into the context window by default.

141
00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:05.439
jackson: And then it's the skill body. Once the AI is like, I'm gonna use this skill, it will read the full content of the skill.nd file.

142
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:19.920
jackson: And then, depending on what's in that skill.nd file, and then depending if you have additional folders and files within your skill, it will then go and find those additional references and files. So it's like a three-step

143
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.360
jackson: system, and the reason that it does this is because AI

144
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:30.940
jackson: Any model you use, any large language model that you use, has a finite context window.

145
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:38.389
jackson: And usually it's something like 200 to 250,000 tokens, and basically.

146
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:45.060
jackson: When you're only loading this front matter of the skill, you're using anything from, like, 50 to…

147
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:53.550
jackson: 200 tokens max. So that's why it's super helpful to, like, have all these preloaded skills

148
00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:00.880
jackson: That aren't taking up, like, a ton of context window. So that you can…

149
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.959
jackson: have AI have more capabilities, but not bloat that context window up front. So it's strategic that the way this is set up, and it's…

150
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.310
jackson: Probably the most effective.

151
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:19.640
jackson: way of… like, enhancing or extending your capabilities with AI without bloating that context window.

152
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:25.020
jackson: Jackson, a couple of clarifications just from chat I wanted to bring up.

153
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:36.180
Ann Marie Almariei: Is it true that each skill, like, has to live in its own folder, or is there ever a case where, you know, skills just kind of stay at a top level?

154
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.850
jackson: So…

155
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:47.450
jackson: to my understanding, it is pretty much always required to have a folder, and then have a skill.md. The only exception there would be

156
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.849
jackson: For example, if you're in Claw Desktop.

157
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.500
jackson: and you actually go to add a skill inside of Quad Desktop.

158
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:58.899
jackson: there's 3 different ways that you can do it. Basically, you can upload

159
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:06.400
jackson: A zip file, which would just be, like, a zipped-up folder with the skill file and other stuff.

160
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.609
jackson: you can…

161
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:13.710
jackson: basically create it with Claude, which is what we're gonna do. And then I believe you could write it yourself, but…

162
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:21.420
jackson: as a part of one of those upload mechanisms, you can just upload a skill.md file. If that's your

163
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:26.500
jackson: Like, if your skill is just that skill.md file, and you don't have the additional

164
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.660
jackson: references and everything else, then you can just upload the skill.m. file.

165
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:43.059
Ann Marie Almariei: And does the name always have to be lowercase kebab format? Because I think, like, the SkillsMD master file is, like, skills, all caps, right?

166
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:50.830
jackson: Yeah, the master file, so I believe you always want the master file to match this format of, like, skill.nd.

167
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.819
jackson: The name for the skill is defined in this Front Matter section.

168
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:04.899
jackson: So, forgive me if this is actually incorrect. We'll look at real front matter. This is, like, an example format.

169
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.849
jackson: The description is sort of on par, but, like.

170
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.809
jackson: The name is defined in the front matter.

171
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:20.069
jackson: So skill.md is the name of the file, but then in the file, the name gets defined there. And we'll look at all this more under the hood later on, but…

172
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.060
jackson: From now…

173
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.460
Ann Marie Almariei: I agree.

174
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.430
jackson: I just want everyone to understand

175
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:33.180
jackson: all it is is a skill, like, it's just a markdown file, and then depending on, like, how complex you want your skill to be, there's other files, but we'll look at all that later.

176
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:51.209
jackson: So how they actually work, we already covered. And then, to just really drive this point home, the description is really, really important, because, again, that's, like, one of the only things that has… or that gets loaded into Claude, or whatever you're using by default.

177
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:57.340
jackson: So if the description is not clear on what the skill is or when to use it.

178
00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:04.639
jackson: then Claude or whatever AI won't know when to trigger it. And so it's not, like, a deal-breaker, because you can still

179
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:10.269
jackson: explicitly tell Claude or whatever, hey, I want to use this skill to do this thing.

180
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:14.729
jackson: But it's just now you're having to do it manually, when you can just…

181
00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:32.479
jackson: basically, have, like, a really well-written description that would tell the AI when to use it automatically, and then it automatically invokes. So, again, not a deal-breaker, just is important to remember that that is a key component to it. So, like, an example of a bad description

182
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:38.099
jackson: for a skill would be, like, generates Google ad campaigns. A better description would be.

183
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:44.210
jackson: generate a full Google Ads search campaign from a landing page URL, and then it gives

184
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.450
jackson: Use when user says X.

185
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:52.530
jackson: Just, like, a kind of… Night and day difference between the description.

186
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:08.600
jackson: And then this is something that I have found to be true. The best skills are actually, like, personalized skills. So, you'll find that a lot of the, big model labs, like Anthropic.

187
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:18.210
jackson: and OpenAI have their own skills that they have made and share with people, and I'll link to those at the end of this, but…

188
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:25.010
jackson: I highly recommend that you start with those, but then figure out ways to

189
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:39.490
jackson: Take either of those skills and modify or refine them to be unique to your use cases and workflows, or just create your own new skills from scratch that are personalized to you.

190
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.009
jackson: One of the demos that we'll walk through is an example of

191
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:50.059
jackson: like, a personalized skill that I made for the business that I mentioned earlier on.

192
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:55.440
jackson: So we'll get to, like, cover what that looks like, but just to…

193
00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:04.910
jackson: plant this seed right now, it's really helpful when you've got these personalized skills, because AI is pretty good already at a lot of general things.

194
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.029
jackson: But when you personalize the skill, like.

195
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.430
jackson: Makes it hone in on the one

196
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.980
jackson: Like, specialized thing that you wanted to do.

197
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:24.979
jackson: So, like, things like your brand voice, or your audience, or your unique positioning are all helpful to kind of embed into your skills, if that's something that you're using it for.

198
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.590
jackson: And then, what skills are not?

199
00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:37.839
jackson: So, you wouldn't want to think of skills as, like, integrations. That's more of, like, the MCP server side of things.

200
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:46.510
jackson: the skills are just basically instructions. They can still integrate with other software, and we'll get to kind of how that works, but they are not, like, by default.

201
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:55.409
jackson: gonna integrate into other software. They're not AI managing other AI. That'd be more like sub-agents. Skills, again, are like the playbook.

202
00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:04.139
jackson: And then they're not saved prompts. Prompts would just vanish after one chat, Skills will persist and improve.

203
00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:09.200
jackson: And then they are not autopilot, so again, skills…

204
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.659
jackson: Will help you with workflows, but they're not gonna, like.

205
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.759
jackson: solve the workflow. I mean, you might be able to, but you still want to judge the output.

206
00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:25.409
jackson: Alright, so building a skill. I'm gonna check how we're doing on…

207
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:32.299
jackson: time. I think we might be a little early to the building skill section, so if…

208
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.460
jackson: helpful. Maybe we do, like, a quick…

209
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.510
jackson: 2-3 minute Q&A at this point.

210
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.480
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah.

211
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.280
jackson: Questions?

212
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:57.369
Ann Marie Almariei: There's a bunch of questions in chat, actually. Chris had a great question, and I think you kind of touched on this. If two people build the same AI skill, what separates a good skill from a great skill?

213
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.360
jackson: So you have two separate people building a skill to do a specific job?

214
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.259
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah, same, same skill. If it's, like.

215
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:15.450
Ann Marie Almariei: let's use the ads one as an example. You know, what would make one skill to build ads better than another skill?

216
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.249
jackson: I think it goes back to the personalization aspect.

217
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:27.680
jackson: So one… one person might be running Google Ads for, like, A mom-and-pop shop.

218
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:41.899
jackson: that is, like, a physical retail store. And so their search ads, they want their campaigns to be structured and designed in a way that would capture, maybe, leads, or generate, like.

219
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:53.170
jackson: interest into driving to the physical store. The other person building that same skill for the search ad campaign creator might be managing, like, a

220
00:46:53.390 --> 00:47:03.099
jackson: online e-commerce store, and are wanting to drive sales, and have a lot different goals and KPIs, and also different

221
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:10.519
jackson: like, brand voice and brand assets. And so, those two people can create their own

222
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.630
jackson: Individual campaign, like, search creator skills.

223
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.080
jackson: that do…

224
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:25.000
jackson: essentially the same thing, but are different in, like, their own unique ways. One is, like, generate leads for my physical retail store, the other one is

225
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.470
jackson: Drive sales to my e-commerce store.

226
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:33.559
jackson: So, different use cases. And also, even in the same ballpark of someone who is

227
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:41.230
jackson: Creating skills for, like, an e-com… like, sorry, creating a search campaign skill for e-commerce.

228
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.019
jackson: Maybe two people who have the same goal of driving sales to an e-commerce store have different experience

229
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:56.500
jackson: running Google Ads, and so will embed their own unique expertise into each skill. So…

230
00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:05.640
jackson: It does sort of create a market for people with domain expertise in something, who create… who can create skills

231
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.979
jackson: That are able to share those skills with other people.

232
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:17.500
jackson: In such a way that, like, someone who doesn't have knowledge of, like, deep expertise in how to run

233
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.090
jackson: the Google Ads for driving conversions.

234
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.559
jackson: Can now package up a skill and give it to somebody who

235
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:32.600
jackson: like, doesn't have that, experience. I think I worded that wrong, but… That's kind of, like… Yes.

236
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:55.359
Ann Marie Almariei: That makes sense. I mean, the skills that James built, for example, he uses a lot of, like, you know, really, famous techniques, you know, that are battle-tested, you know, you know, he'll reference the greats, like, he has a direct marketing, skill that's, like, right like Ogilvy, you know, so he's

237
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.969
Ann Marie Almariei: baking in a lot of that expertise, so I think that makes the difference.

238
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.940
jackson: John, you have your hand up. Do you want to ask a question?

239
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:18.450
John Vishnesky: Yeah, that'd be awesome. Hey, thanks, Jax, for doing this. This is awesome so far. But my question is, how are you storing your skills, to access them on, like, multiple projects? So, like, what I've been doing is, like.

240
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:29.559
John Vishnesky: I'll start a new project, and usually I'll just build out a skill for that project, or I'll, like, import one from, like, a GitHub repository or something. Just want to know, like, how you're doing that.

241
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.289
jackson: Yeah, that's a definitely good question.

242
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:45.160
jackson: What I've done is I've created a folder on my computer called Skills, and then inside that I have a custom folder, and then an official folder. Inside of that custom folder.

243
00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:47.960
jackson: I'll drop any skill I make

244
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:52.449
jackson: that I make from anywhere. So if I make a skill in Claw Desktop.

245
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:58.380
jackson: I'll download that from Cloud Desktop and drop it into the skill folder, or if I create a

246
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:01.680
jackson: skill in, like, another project, then I will port it in.

247
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:08.179
jackson: there is some drift that occurs, because now I'm having to, like, maintain

248
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:13.749
jackson: two, like, skills in two places, and so I've thought about ways of…

249
00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:17.809
jackson: Handling that, and there is a way to basically link

250
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.629
jackson: Files on your computer so that, like.

251
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.739
jackson: You create something in one place.

252
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:28.459
jackson: And then have it exist in, like, another project folder on your computer.

253
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:36.010
jackson: as, like, a reference, and so you actually only have to edit it one place. I have also, seen on the…

254
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:53.150
jackson: internet that, when using that method, it isn't always so reliable that whatever clot or cursor will pick up your skill. So, that is definitely, like, something that's unsolved, and I guess the answer would be it just requires, like, a high level of organization to be able to.

255
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.950
John Vishnesky: Okay.

256
00:50:54.190 --> 00:51:00.279
jackson: Somebody needs to make an app for that. You could also make, exactly, you could make an app for managing, like, your skills.

257
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:07.970
jackson: But, maybe, like, a cheap way around this is maybe you create all your skills in Quad.

258
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:17.360
jackson: And use that as, like, your master, skill creator, because every skill you make there, you can then add to

259
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:28.640
jackson: you're basically added to your Cloud account, so, like, a skill that you create on Claude Desktop, as soon as you add it into Claude Desktop, if you pull out your phone and open the Claude app.

260
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:39.519
jackson: that skill is now on your Cloud mobile app, as long as it's enabled. So, like, basically, that would be a great way of managing it, and I've…

261
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:47.350
jackson: sort of try to do that, and but like I said, it's just kind of like… it's… you definitely have to finesse a little bit.

262
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:48.640
John Vishnesky: For sure.

263
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.220
John Vishnesky: Cool. Thanks, man.

264
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.879
jackson: Alright, so… I believe… what do you think, AMA? Should we dive into building skill?

265
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:09.879
Ann Marie Almariei: We have a couple more questions, up to you. Do you wanna… do you wanna talk about, some of the high-level stuff first, or do you want to dig into building?

266
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:17.270
jackson: Let's dig into building, and then once it's building, we'll have time for more questions, because it'll take a little bit to build.

267
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:19.870
jackson: So let's make a skeleton.

268
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:25.770
jackson: Just to kind of recap before we dive into making a skill, because

269
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:29.449
jackson: I'll ask the audience what we want to build here.

270
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:35.030
jackson: So that you have some context of, like, what would make a good skill if you maybe aren't…

271
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.609
jackson: Having any ideas? Basically, anything

272
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:47.340
jackson: that is, like, repeatable, explainable, and then contained would make a good skill. Doesn't have to, I guess, embody all of these things, but just…

273
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:54.679
jackson: to frame what we're about to do next, if anyone has a skill idea, just go ahead and drop that, and then we'll…

274
00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.009
jackson: Go ahead and build one of those.

275
00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:02.759
jackson: And so, we're gonna build it now. So, I'm going to switch over to…

276
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.880
jackson: com… or actually, I'm gonna switch browsers here.

277
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.580
jackson: Alright, can y'all see my screen now?

278
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.309
jackson: If I'm on the clock on the island…

279
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:23.810
Tony Morinello: small.

280
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.060
Ann Marie Almariei: Super… super tiny.

281
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.499
Ann Marie Almariei: You must have, like… We can zoom in, we have the technology.

282
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.820
jackson: So this is Claude.ai, I'm sure people are familiar with this.

283
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:44.060
jackson: To create a skilled quad, or to see what skills you already have, you're gonna open the sidebar, you're gonna scroll… actually, not scroll… click on Settings.

284
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:47.850
jackson: Alright? Go to capabilities.

285
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:56.770
jackson: So, under capabilities is where you're going to find existing skills that you've made and that Anthropic includes by default. Scroll down.

286
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.430
jackson: You'll see skills.

287
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:10.809
jackson: And then you have two tabs. You have your skills, these are ones that you create and then add in Claude, and you have example skills, and these are ones Anthropic includes by default.

288
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.929
jackson: If you go here, you'll notice

289
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.589
jackson: Basically, all of these are disabled, and that's…

290
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.850
jackson: disabled by default, so Anthropic doesn't, enable

291
00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:35.549
jackson: these, like, automatically, you have to go in and tick them on. The only one that they do enable by default, I'll enable that one, is this one, and it's the skill creator skill. So this is the only skill Claude has on

292
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.840
jackson: for everyone who has a Claude account.

293
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.749
jackson: And it is the skill that makes skills.

294
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:49.729
jackson: So, what I'm gonna do, and you can all do this as well, I'm just gonna click the three dots, click Try and Chat. What that does is it opens a new chat.

295
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:56.049
jackson: And then… autofills this prompt, basically asking Claude to create a skill for me.

296
00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.680
jackson: So, right now, there's no guidance. I could hit send on this.

297
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:12.249
jackson: And it might go read through our chat history, or pull memory, and then see what skill I would most be benefited by, and just start building it.

298
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.449
jackson: If we have any ideas from

299
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:20.259
jackson: Anyone here, as to a skill that we could build, we can build one of those.

300
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.419
Ann Marie Almariei: There was a suggestion from Moe for competitive research.

301
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.190
jackson: Let's do it. Okay. And I'm seeing some people say.

302
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.560
jackson: They don't see the default skills of Claude.

303
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:49.360
jackson: just make sure that you're… you can be on cloud.ai or the desktop. If you're on mobile, you won't see skills, just by the way. If you're on the mobile app, you can't access the skills. You have to be on a desktop computer. So let's make a competitor

304
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.619
jackson: research skill. Great idea.

305
00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:00.760
jackson: Let's make a competitor… research skill.

306
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:12.899
jackson: And so, now… once it actually starts building the skill, we'll do some Q&A, but there might be some…

307
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.530
jackson: Up front. So, you can see it's reading the skill.

308
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.949
jackson: to create other skills. So this is how you know it's working.

309
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.119
jackson: It read the skill creator skill.

310
00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:47.719
jackson: So I actually already had a skill enabled on here for audience research, so it's like, oh, let me reference that existing skill you already have, and make something unique. And so…

311
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:54.120
jackson: Now it's actually creating the skill. So this might take, like, a minute or two. We can…

312
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.059
jackson: Pop off one of these questions that we might have.

313
00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:02.009
Ann Marie Almariei: Do you want me to roll through, or do you see them?

314
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:09.320
jackson: I see one, so this one is related to Cloud Code. It looks like they're asking.

315
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.879
jackson: Tom is asking, if you create a skill locally, is it available on the mobile app as well?

316
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:23.329
jackson: No, only the skills that you make inside of the claw desktop or the claw.ai

317
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:28.669
jackson: UI will be available across your Cloud apps. Claude code

318
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.819
jackson: load skills in a different way, which we'll show.

319
00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.460
jackson: And a bit. And that's also why

320
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:40.370
jackson: I believe John asked earlier, about how to, like, share skills.

321
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.199
jackson: Did you see one AMA?

322
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:54.160
Ann Marie Almariei: Let's see, should we have niche down for the competitor research skill?

323
00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:03.200
jackson: Great, great question. And my answer is, if you're doing this for real, I'd say yes, you'd probably want to niche down. But the fact that we're just, you know, demoing.

324
00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.889
jackson: We're gonna get a… we're gonna get a skill back.

325
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:10.510
jackson: That does competitor research. How good the skill is, is TBD.

326
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:18.789
jackson: But the great thing about this is once it gives us the skill.md file, we can load it up into our Cloud app.

327
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:20.260
jackson: And then we can…

328
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:35.210
jackson: Ask Claude, in this same conversation, or in a new one, I want to improve my competitor research skill, help me do that, and it'll use the same skill it's using now, the skill creator skill, to actually improve upon this skill. So.

329
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:46.090
jackson: once you make a skill, it's not like it's set in stone. You can always refine and optimize it. So, if it sucks out of the gate, like, out of the gate, just know that you can improve it.

330
00:58:47.140 --> 00:59:02.120
Ann Marie Almariei: Ali mentioned, actually, you know… Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Ali mentioned, you know, do you have to feed target audience competitors, in order to get a good skill? Now, I imagine it's…

331
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:09.460
Ann Marie Almariei: Claude is pulling from what it knows about your business already, most likely, but I would think the answer to that would be, yeah.

332
00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.140
jackson: Yeah, I guess so this…

333
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:18.140
jackson: is where it gets into, like, how much context does Quad have about you and about your goals?

334
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:23.500
jackson: So, what you could do at the beginning of creating a skill, is…

335
00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:33.889
jackson: if you don't have memory enabled, maybe you, like, you turn on the clawed memory feature, which allows it to, like, establish memory about you, or if you don't want to do that.

336
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:39.000
jackson: Which, I've had mixed results of doing that. You can also just upload files

337
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:44.270
jackson: that you want it to have. So, if you have, like, a business or a project.

338
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:48.199
jackson: You can just, like, create a summary file of that.

339
00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:53.210
jackson: give it to Claude and say, make me a competitor research skill based on, like, this project.

340
00:59:53.700 --> 01:00:00.740
jackson: And what I like to do is… it sounds really basic and, like, simple, but…

341
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.099
jackson: at the end of the prompt, I'll just be like.

342
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:16.079
jackson: you know, make me this skill, and then make it really good and valuable for, like, my use case or whatever. Just, like, specify you want it to be good. Because sometimes if you don't, Claude will just do something.

343
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:20.560
jackson: And it's like, it could have done it better, as long as you just have to specify, like.

344
01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.239
jackson: make it really, really good. I often… I often will append that to my prompts and be like.

345
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:32.279
jackson: do X, make it really good. And I think that I get better outputs, but that could also just be me.

346
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.979
jackson: Alright, so it made the skill.nd file, so…

347
01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:42.259
jackson: Let's read quickly what it said. I'm gonna hide this for now. This is the actual file.

348
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:50.950
jackson: So here's your competitor research skill. It actually created 3 files. So it made a skill.nd file, the required one that we need.

349
01:00:51.780 --> 01:01:05.799
jackson: Then it had two other files that it included into a reference folder. So it has output templates, so basically how it wants, the research to be output, and then also some methodology.

350
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:16.070
jackson: And you can see it actually took, like, some frameworks that are not just, like, generic frameworks. It actually has,

351
01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:20.049
jackson: Like, some pretty… I guess, highly,

352
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:24.429
jackson: Primed frameworks for this skill to be effective.

353
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:35.809
jackson: So yeah, anyways, now we have a skill.md and then the other two files. I'm gonna see if this works. So sometimes…

354
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.339
jackson: when you make a skill inside a quad.

355
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.719
jackson: it has the capability to package it up and just make it a one-click install, so I'm gonna…

356
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:51.209
jackson: try that right now. It's not always reliable, but when it does work, it just kind of helps to…

357
01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.910
jackson: Quickly add this skill.

358
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:59.100
jackson: So I'm just gonna say, package it up, as a one… click.

359
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.780
jackson: Install.

360
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.070
jackson: And if this doesn't work, you can also just

361
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.109
jackson: download these, and I'll show you how you would upload it that way as well.

362
01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.620
jackson: Let's see if we can just do this.

363
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:21.329
jackson: Sweet. Okay, so now what it did…

364
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.679
jackson: Is it basically packaged these 3 files?

365
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:31.520
jackson: into a .skill file, and a .skill file is basically just a zip file

366
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.209
jackson: But it is, like, unique to this format, so…

367
01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.709
jackson: Now you'll see I can just click on copy to my skills.

368
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.359
jackson: And then I'll see a notification

369
01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:49.530
jackson: in the right, that says copied to your skills, and now if I go on

370
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:55.720
jackson: Manage, and I go down, you'll see I have a competitor research skill there now.

371
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.300
jackson: So…

372
01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:12.279
jackson: If Claude doesn't give you that, just, like.skill file whenever you're making a skill, just prompt it and be like, hey, package this up for me so that I can just one-click install. And it should work. Not always reliable.

373
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.060
jackson: But if that doesn't happen, and you have trouble, just know.

374
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:26.290
jackson: What you can also do is… so these were the three files, skilled that it initially gave. I'm just gonna download them all.

375
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:32.380
jackson: And so it downloaded that already as a zip file. Now I just need to go

376
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.669
jackson: Back into my settings.

377
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.160
jackson: Back down to capabilities.

378
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.140
jackson: And then under the skills section, I'll just click Add.

379
01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:49.439
jackson: And these are the 3 ways you can make a skill inside a Claw that I was talking about.

380
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.350
jackson: So now I'm just gonna upload a skill, and this is where you can upload either a .zip.

381
01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:02.169
jackson: or .skill, or just simply a skill.md file, and COD will pick it up. So long as…

382
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:08.019
jackson: like the skill is properly formatted, so it needs to be in the proper format. But now I'm gonna…

383
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.170
jackson: Upload the zip file that we just got.

384
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:17.749
jackson: And it's asking, do I want to replace the competitor research skill? Because it's the same skill that we just…

385
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:20.959
jackson: Copied in, I'll just say sure, because it's the same skill.

386
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.759
jackson: Okay, I think that worked. If not, we still have it. And so.

387
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:36.449
jackson: Now that we have this skill in here, I just kind of want to quickly call this out.

388
01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:51.719
jackson: I'm on the Your Skills tab, so this is, like, custom skills that we've made. If we recap, the example skills, those are ones that Claude has already included for us, and in addition to Skill Creator, there's other stuff.

389
01:04:52.010 --> 01:05:06.780
jackson: the Your Skills, these are the ones that we add, so anything we create with Quad would go in the Your Skills category, but now what I can do is I can click those three dots that we clicked on the skill creator earlier.

390
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:11.600
jackson: And I can… basically do the same thing where I try this in the chat.

391
01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:20.079
jackson: and it, like, basically demos the skill for me. I can download it, I can edit it, and I can also replace, so…

392
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.620
jackson: If you wanted to share this skill with other people, you can download this and then send it to

393
01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:35.920
jackson: whoever, and they can just quickly upload it into their clot, or if they have, like, cursor, then they just use that format, which we'll talk about.

394
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:43.529
jackson: But if I say, try and chat, it's now the same prompt, but it just replaced the skill, so now it's the competitor research skill.

395
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:53.010
jackson: And then say, I'm gonna do this demo of… I work at… Anthropic.

396
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.740
jackson: And want to research… OpenAI.

397
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:03.740
jackson: So now it's gonna go off and do competitor research as if I'm working at

398
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.630
jackson: Anthropic, and it's gonna research OpenAI.

399
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:07.680
jackson: But…

400
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:16.439
jackson: We don't have to sit through this, because we also have some actual live demos that we'll do, unless people want to sit through this and see

401
01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.059
jackson: In real time, how this would work, but…

402
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.129
jackson: We do have 3 demos that we can show, as well.

403
01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:33.620
jackson: for the heck of it, let's just… let's just sit through it, because I'm actually curious what it comes back with. In the meantime, does anyone have any questions that we can answer? Let's check the chat.

404
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.510
Ann Marie Almariei: There's lots of questions in chat.

405
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.940
jackson: Nice, okay.

406
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.279
jackson: Do you see any good ones?

407
01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.970
Ann Marie Almariei: Well, let's see,

408
01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:58.839
Ann Marie Almariei: Chris had asked, if it's possible to use another app like Perplexity for competitive research in the skill, or, you know, is that the same thing?

409
01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:03.050
Ann Marie Almariei: So, for perplexity…

410
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:13.939
jackson: That's an interesting one. Like I said, this format, this standard is being rolled out to a lot of different apps. I don't know if Perplexity is one of those yet.

411
01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.730
jackson: Or whether they even plan to roll something like that out.

412
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.090
jackson: But,

413
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:27.150
jackson: So you could use perplexity how you would use it today, and just say, do competitor research on Axe?

414
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:31.280
jackson: And it would basically give you a lot of,

415
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:42.500
jackson: whatever output it gives you would differ over time. With this skill, like, we're getting the same output, because it has everything that we want defined up front.

416
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:49.240
jackson: But I don't know if Perplexity has the, skill.nd format adopted yet. I don't…

417
01:07:49.240 --> 01:08:02.300
Ann Marie Almariei: Yeah, I'm not sure about that either, but I do know you can connect to Perplexity. If you… if you did the skill, like, in Cloud Code, then you could connect it… so, like, you could tell your skill

418
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:10.830
Ann Marie Almariei: use Perplexity for my research, and then you could have Claude do, like, the summary or analysis, for example.

419
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:27.629
jackson: Actually, yeah, that's a great point. So, you can have a competitor research skill that instructs Claude or whatever to use perplexity, so long as you have, perplexity, like, connected. You can connect perplexity in a lot of different ways.

420
01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.699
jackson: That is, like, one use case in how you could do it, though.

421
01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:47.629
Ann Marie Almariei: Now, Tony mentioned, like, for web search and research, he uses the Perplexity MCP. Like, what is the difference between using an MCP and, like, connecting, you know, an API, a Perplexity API?

422
01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:53.599
jackson: So you can use MCP servers inside of…

423
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:59.400
jackson: like, the Quad desktop app, for example, allows you to connect those MCP servers, right?

424
01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:07.249
jackson: And MCPs are wrappers around APIs. So Perplexity, the app.

425
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:17.129
jackson: has basically their front-facing website and product that people can use. But they also have this, like, back-end underlying

426
01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:23.089
jackson: API that… you don't… like, you can leverage their API,

427
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:32.539
jackson: to not have to go to Perplexity.com to do things. And what an MCP is, is it takes that API, that functionality of the app.

428
01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:38.380
jackson: And it lets you bring it into Quad, so instead of having to go to Perplexity.com.

429
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:48.679
jackson: for .ai, you can just go to Claude, as long as you have it connected, and say, use Perplexity to search this, and it will use the API,

430
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.309
jackson: Of perplexity to go do the search.

431
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.210
jackson: an MCP server is just, like, the API

432
01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:03.080
jackson: formatted for AI, in a sort of very basic sense. Okay, cool.

433
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:18.310
jackson: We got our research back. It's just a big markdown file, so the output template that was in this skill probably specified, give me a markdown file and have it structured like so. We're not gonna read through that whole thing, but…

434
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:28.070
jackson: you know, we can just quickly read through this, and I understand that, like, this was a really generic skill that we made. Like, someone mentioned, can we…

435
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:46.089
jackson: add, or should we niche down on this? And the answer is, like, you probably should try to at least get a little more specific with skill creation, because we could have just asked Claude straight up to do competitor research for us, and probably gotten a really similar output back. So, like.

436
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:56.350
jackson: if I'm being honest, this might not be the greatest, use case, unless we were to, like, personalize it. So, just a little…

437
01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.240
jackson: Quick tidbit there, but yeah, anyways.

438
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:17.270
Ann Marie Almariei: What if you did want to, like, personalize it further? So, like, you're seeing the output here of the competitive, and you see something that you want to change. So, you know, if you wanted the core insight, like, broken out into a couple of categories, for example.

439
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:23.750
Ann Marie Almariei: Do you just prompt it here to update the skill, and refine it?

440
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.819
jackson: Yes, you can do that.

441
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:30.960
jackson: So, update the competitor research skill.

442
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.830
jackson: to break the core insights out… I'm just gonna say out more.

443
01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:41.149
jackson: Give me even more granular data.

444
01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.220
jackson: Precise.

445
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.090
jackson: We won't watch this full thing, but I'll show you now. It should…

446
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.159
jackson: So now it's rereading the skill it just used.

447
01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:08.989
jackson: And so now it's gonna also re-read our Skill Creator skill, because that skill in the description is defined as use when improving skills.

448
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:12.939
jackson: So you'll notice it read the skill that we wanted to improve.

449
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.359
jackson: And then it read, the skill used to improve skills.

450
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:22.529
jackson: So, this was an example of Claude knowing when to use the skill. So now it's…

451
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:32.149
jackson: going off and improving on that skill. So, great use case of, like, alright, I made a skill, I don't like how the output is, I want this to be different.

452
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:47.469
jackson: let me improve it, and then boom, right in the same conversation, we're just improving it. We can also do this in a new conversation, just reference both, or just reference the competitor research skill and say, I want to improve this skill. Same thing.

453
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:53.490
jackson: Alright, so let's actually… Keep going.

454
01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.160
jackson: So, quick recap, that was a skill.

455
01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:57.670
jackson: Obviously.

456
01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:05.740
jackson: So yeah, just a quick note, a skill… Is not quite finished.

457
01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:13.509
jackson: like, again, just do some quality checking on the first draft, because you can always refine it.

458
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:19.980
jackson: And then you can even, if you don't know what… like, if you don't understand the quality and you aren't able to…

459
01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:33.209
jackson: I guess, judge the quality, given a lack of domain knowledge. You can ask Claude to approach this from whatever domain that you want to create a skill in. Say you're

460
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.080
jackson: Creating the competitor research skill.

461
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:51.829
jackson: and you want to improve it, but you're not a competitive researcher or analysis type person, just tell Claude, hey, from a competitor research and analysis type perspective, can you improve my competitor research skill? And it will…

462
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.659
jackson: go fetch what it needs to kind of know how to improve it. So you don't actually have to know

463
01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:02.479
jackson: how to do something to make a skill that does something, and I'll show you an example of that later, but…

464
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:10.110
jackson: Also, keep an eye out for under-triggering, and not as often over-triggering. It doesn't really happen that much.

465
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:17.570
jackson: It's usually a case of under-triggering that it just doesn't know to reference, so just…

466
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.990
jackson: Maybe improve your description if that happens.

467
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.639
jackson: Right up. Live demos.

468
01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.539
jackson: Let's get into it.

469
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:34.020
jackson: So, we're gonna demo 3 skills. The first one is like a… somewhat generic.

470
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:45.949
jackson: skill that would take a landing page URL and create a search campaign around it, and that would be in the domain or context of driving purchases.

471
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.960
jackson: Or, actually, in this case, it would be sign-ups.

472
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.300
jackson: And then, we're gonna use…

473
01:14:51.560 --> 01:15:00.269
jackson: a real skill that I made for the business that I ran, which was a branded HTML email generator, so I…

474
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:06.059
jackson: Give it a… quick prompt of, like, hey, I need a new email for my…

475
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:10.249
jackson: Business, whatever, and it just cooks up a skill for me, and then…

476
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:19.050
jackson: The third skill we're gonna look at is a more advanced one. We'll actually use Quad Code for it, and this will be an example of a skill that

477
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:21.059
jackson: actually can…

478
01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:29.499
jackson: connect to other APIs, and then do more advanced things, so we'll get to that one at the end. But let's start with

479
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:35.200
jackson: this search campaign architect. So let's… Click on this.

480
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:43.440
jackson: So I just clicked that link, and I basically set it up so that it works the same way as those

481
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:52.100
jackson: try and chat functionality works. It just preloads a prompt in Claw.ai to basically use that skill.

482
01:15:52.500 --> 01:16:00.160
jackson: And so, I already have this skill enabled in Claude for my account, so this will be a real

483
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:06.189
jackson: Like, it knows what's referenced, and the page that we're gonna make a search campaign around is actually the…

484
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:11.010
jackson: It's the product page for Claude. So let's take this URL.

485
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.090
jackson: And it's basically looking to…

486
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:21.250
jackson: acquire leads and sign-ups for their app or their product. So let's take the URL and go back to Claude.

487
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.450
jackson: And say, here is the landing page.

488
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:34.550
jackson: So it's starting by referencing the skill.

489
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:38.359
jackson: Again, you kind of want to look for that, make sure they actually breathe the skill.

490
01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:44.999
jackson: Because oftentimes, you'll give it a prompt, think it uses a skill, and then find out that it actually never read the skill.

491
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.069
jackson: And so it's…

492
01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:59.580
jackson: going and reading through this skill that I made, because there's reference files on how to, like, structure ad copy, how to create negative keywords, how to structure all the ad groups, etc.

493
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:01.800
jackson: So it's reading through all of that.

494
01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.529
jackson: In the meantime, let's answer some questions.

495
01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:11.569
Ann Marie Almariei: I have a good one from Chris.

496
01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:31.439
Ann Marie Almariei: He said, how do I build a skill that gets better over time from corrections? He ghostwrites for his CEO, and, you know, he's trying to improve his voice over time. So how would you recommend that he keeps his skill up to date?

497
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.720
jackson: The most manual way to do it would just say.

498
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.359
jackson: After every output that you get from using the skill, you can just say.

499
01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:44.860
jackson: like, add your feedback, basically, so…

500
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:50.069
jackson: If it gives you an output and you realize it's throwing in a ton of phrases.

501
01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:51.799
jackson: That you don't like.

502
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:57.149
jackson: And the follow-up message, just say, hey, don't include all of these phrases

503
01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.779
jackson: And then, it will update the skill. And then, basically, it will, like.

504
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.520
jackson: Throw you back into the skill creator mode.

505
01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.250
jackson: But that's, like, the most manual way of doing it.

506
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:13.770
jackson: As far as automated ways to improve skills over time.

507
01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:20.970
jackson: There aren't really any, unless you're using Like, open claw or something.

508
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.110
jackson: a little bit more advanced, but even then, it's kind of like… the quality isn't there, so I guess…

509
01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:28.100
jackson: For this, just…

510
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:44.510
jackson: every time you get an output, if you don't see something you like, say, I don't like all the M dashes, remove those and update the skill, it will update the skill for you, and then you just have to recopy it back into your Claude account, basically, if you wanted to do that.

511
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:57.410
Ann Marie Almariei: I have an anti-AI JSON file that I did, like, eons ago that I've turned into a skill, and I do not get m dashes anywhere in my copy.

512
01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:14.969
Ann Marie Almariei: It's really good. One other thing, maybe, that, could be done is, like, scraping context first, again. Like, if you have a context file that you keep up to date with voice notes, is that a way that you could do it?

513
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:23.359
jackson: You could do that. I should reiterate, too, that if you're improving a skill like that, like a writing skill.

514
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:29.459
jackson: Typically, what you'd have is, within the skill folder, you'd have skill.md.

515
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.139
jackson: And then, alongside it, you'd have references.

516
01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:45.380
jackson: Inside the references folder is where you would include things like, do this, don't do this, and then as you are refining the skill as you use it, what

517
01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:55.320
jackson: Claude will do is just add more context to the reference files. It will keep the skill file alone, because all the skill file is, is just instructions.

518
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.839
jackson: That reference the other files.

519
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:03.419
jackson: So, like, once you're saying, hey, don't like the M dashes, remove those.

520
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:08.659
jackson: Claude will likely add this to a reference file. If it's…

521
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:25.499
jackson: you have to also kind of keep an eye on Claw to make sure, or whatever you're using to make a skill, to make sure it's updating the skill in the right way, which is why it's highly recommended to use the skill creator skill, or make your own Skill Creator skill, like James created

522
01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:29.210
jackson: He basically created his own skill creator skill.

523
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:39.220
jackson: That he gave away for free to the community, and it's basically taking the core skill creator that, Anthropic made, and it is…

524
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:44.519
jackson: Just enhancing it with his own… Taste and expertise, and it's…

525
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.090
Ann Marie Almariei: It goes really deep.

526
01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:54.320
jackson: it's a lot different experience. So, you know, you can use either, but definitely when you're making, updating.

527
01:20:54.580 --> 01:21:03.619
jackson: Any skill, just use a skill creator type skill. It doesn't have to be the one Anthropic made by default, but that one is a really good starting place.

528
01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.420
jackson: But yeah, definitely use one of those. So that way you know

529
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:13.390
jackson: That you're formatting it correctly, that you're following all the best practices for skills, because again, there are

530
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:25.360
jackson: Many different apps you can use them in, but you have to have, like, the core foundation kind of structured properly and set up correct for it to be able to work across apps.

531
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:35.760
jackson: So, it finished with our… Search campaign architect, and it basically gave us a document that is this…

532
01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.730
jackson: Extensive map, essentially, of…

533
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:46.680
jackson: how we might structure a search campaign, given the URL we gave it, which we gave a URL

534
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:53.530
jackson: for Claude, the sort of product page for just the Claude app, or Claude.ai.

535
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:56.930
jackson: And what it gave us back was…

536
01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:10.830
jackson: a full kind of analysis. And again, this is all defined within the skill. I said, give me an analysis followed by X, Y, and Z. So it starts with the landing page analysis, it gives us the URL,

537
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:17.370
jackson: It lists what the primary value prop is, who the target audience might be, what our conversion goal is.

538
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:20.899
jackson: Some proof points, and then a little bit of a competitive moat.

539
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.980
jackson: I found this funny, I was demoing this.

540
01:22:25.450 --> 01:22:33.380
jackson: And it definitely emphasizes the fact that Claude is ad-free as its competitive moat. And actually, I think in the copy.

541
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:40.499
jackson: Yeah, no ads, just helpful AI. So it took all the context from that page.

542
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.619
jackson: Made all of these ad groups, essentially, and each ad group

543
01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:59.480
jackson: has different search, keywords and intent. The first one is just brand terms. So we're capturing branded search terms for the landing page that we gave it, which in this case was Claude. So Claude…

544
01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:01.960
jackson: AI assistant, claw.ai.

545
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:07.339
jackson: And then it gives us match types for those keywords, it gives us intent for those keywords.

546
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:11.649
jackson: And it gives us specific ad copy for each ad group, so it's…

547
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:18.030
jackson: And it also gives us descriptions, tells us how to pin headlines if we wanted to pin headlines.

548
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:26.260
jackson: And this also… there's more ad groups as well, there's, like, a problem aware, there's feature-specific.

549
01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:31.959
jackson: And then it gives negative keywords, so don't, you know, exclude these ones.

550
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:41.290
jackson: It should also… okay, add extensions. It gives us site links, so these are additional assets we can include on our search ads.

551
01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:55.619
jackson: So, every search ad that you make can also include site links, it can include callouts, it doesn't just have to have headlines and descriptions. And in fact, you'd want to include these things because it helps with CTR, and so this skill.

552
01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:04.699
jackson: has that knowledge baked in. It knows, okay, when we're making a search campaign, don't just give out 4 headlines and 2 descriptions for this page.

553
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:09.519
jackson: Have it be complete with site links, call-out extensions, structured snippets, etc.

554
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:21.079
jackson: So that we have the best chance when we're launching the search campaign. Like, this would be somewhat of an example of a skill that has a little bit of domain expertise included into it.

555
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:32.199
jackson: But anyways, that is how that skill works. Any quick questions on that skill in particular before we move on to the next one? Did we see any in there?

556
01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:38.420
jackson: Let's see if we have one… on that.

557
01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:50.379
jackson: So this specific example, can you just prompt Claude to output this type of info? What advantage does creating a skill have over a regular chat with Claude?

558
01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.119
jackson: Yes, you could.

559
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:58.090
jackson: But you will not get a document, or… unless you prompt it.

560
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:02.020
jackson: And you would have to prompt it pretty extensively to say.

561
01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:17.450
jackson: here's a landing page URL. What I want you to do is create a document, have it laid out like this, have it include all of these. Instead of doing all that, I just made a skill that has that all baked into it by default, so that all I have to say is

562
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.900
jackson: is, hey, can you go do something amazing with this skill? Here's the landing page. And in fact, I could just say.

563
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:35.249
jackson: make me a search campaign based on this landing page, paste the landing page, and I would get the same report. It wouldn't actually… because it would load the skill, because it knows

564
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:42.159
jackson: user is trying to create a search campaign, let me use the Google search campaign skill and deliver

565
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:46.530
jackson: the proper format. So you can definitely prompt Claude

566
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.290
jackson: By default, to do that, but it's definitely not going to be the same output.

567
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.810
jackson: And I think Fernando has a question.

568
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:58.680
fernando.santana: Hey, how's it going? So I actually work in…

569
01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:12.869
fernando.santana: And this is, like, amazing, because I know one of the biggest things is trying to save time, especially in the industry where things are getting offshore and whatnot. So let's say, for instance, I approve this plan. Can I then prompt the skill to say, oh, now.

570
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:22.100
fernando.santana: create an Excel bulk sheet for me to make it easy for my team to now upload this in, like, an editor, because that'll cut a significant amount of time for us, too.

571
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.840
jackson: Yes, you can. And actually, you can take it a step further.

572
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.119
fernando.santana: I don't want to get too into it, but you can take that a step further, I think another skill.

573
01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.240
jackson: That actually connects to Google Ads API, and if you feel…

574
01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:40.989
jackson: risky enough, you can be like, alright, now just upload this to Google Ads. And it'll take this plan.

575
01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.489
jackson: Create all the assets in Google Ads, and boom.

576
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.940
fernando.santana: Sure.

577
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.820
jackson: We've got a full campaign.

578
01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:50.950
fernando.santana: And I just have to… the skill probably just have a line that says, upload as paused, right? So that can QA everything.

579
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.680
fernando.santana: Sure.

580
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.310
jackson: Yeah.

581
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:53.940
jackson: Yes.

582
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:55.080
jackson: Again, do that.

583
01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:55.800
fernando.santana: Awesome.

584
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.460
jackson: Awesome.

585
01:26:57.050 --> 01:27:06.640
fernando.santana: And then, last question, I don't take up too much time, can I connect this to, like, the Google Keyword Planner as well, to get, like, a column of max, minimum, CPC, and then monthly search volume as well?

586
01:27:07.150 --> 01:27:15.369
jackson: The Google Ads API has a lot available. I have used it pretty extensively. I haven't personally tried the Keyword Planner.

587
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:16.400
fernando.santana: Yep.

588
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.570
jackson: But if it's available in the API, it's available via…

589
01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.699
jackson: the… it's available via this. You can make a skill for it, definitely.

590
01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:29.249
fernando.santana: Okay, cool, thank you, appreciate that. Oh, and this is going to be available to us as well, or no?

591
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:35.930
jackson: I'm gonna include this skill at the follow-up, yes, and I will also say that regarding the,

592
01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.990
jackson: connection to Google Ads.

593
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:51.169
jackson: off-topic a little bit, but I have a MCP server that I built using Quad. I… there's an MCP builder skill. I just built an MCP server for Google Ads that allows you to

594
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:55.900
jackson: basically query Google Ads, and then it will also allow you to

595
01:27:56.210 --> 01:28:04.520
jackson: write or create things in Google Ads, with, like, some safety guidelines in place, so there's, like, a dry run

596
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.509
jackson: feature enabled by default, so that you can approve it, and that MCP server is

597
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.569
jackson: open source, I'll include that at the end as well.

598
01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.349
jackson: And definitely, like.

599
01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:27.030
jackson: start slow. I know it sounds really, enticing to just go fast. I will not be responsible for anybody's ad budgets, just saying that. I am working with this, but…

600
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:32.389
jackson: I'm doing it at a very slow pace relative to what I think is possible.

601
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.120
fernando.santana: Yeah, it makes all sense. But no, this is… this is great. Thanks so much for showing me this, appreciate it.

602
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.670
jackson: Of course. And someone asked.

603
01:28:39.670 --> 01:28:47.349
Ann Marie Almariei: And you can always ask Claude, right? Like, if you don't know what you're doing, and you're not sure, just ask… just ask Claude.

604
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:56.330
jackson: Of course, yeah, you can always ask Vlad. Someone asked, can a skill prompt or invoke another skill? The answer is yes, it can.

605
01:28:56.550 --> 01:29:05.539
jackson: you can definitely chain skills together. The same way you can chain a skill with an MCP server, and the same way you can also chain a skill with a sub-agent.

606
01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.220
jackson: You can definitely do that.

607
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:13.180
jackson: Alright, let's go to the next example, because I think… This will be…

608
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:26.450
jackson: a little bit more pertinent for people also, maybe. So this second skill, I built back, I think, in November, so like a month after skills were launched, I saw it being

609
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:36.140
jackson: I basically saw skills get, like, super popular. I was like, what is this all about? Before skills, there were these slash commands that you could use in Cloud code.

610
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:43.299
jackson: And what slash commands were, were basically pre-written prompts, essentially.

611
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.380
jackson: And I was using that to generate emails, because I had

612
01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:50.549
jackson: a slash command that basically told Claude.

613
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:55.030
jackson: Go reference all these files in the folder that we're in right now.

614
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:57.990
jackson: and see how I made emails

615
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:03.990
jackson: look at the site links for my actual website, so that you're pulling real links. It was…

616
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:11.560
jackson: basically what a skill is, just a lot more primitive form. So, once skills got released, you can then

617
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:16.100
jackson: sort of encapsulate all the instructions I had in that

618
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:20.880
jackson: Slash command became a skill that was self-contained.

619
01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:27.850
jackson: And so I no longer had to have Claude code to generate emails, because I had all these references to, like.

620
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:39.780
jackson: past emails, and the template I use, all this stuff, that a slash command, all the slash command was, was a single file, but the skill is a self-contained, it can have all those references in it.

621
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:46.940
jackson: So I just asked Claude, hey, can you turn my slash command into a skill? And then it did it. It packaged it up really nice.

622
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.119
jackson: So now, if I want to create an email, I can actually do this in…

623
01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.880
jackson: the Cloud Web UI.

624
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:57.050
jackson: because,

625
01:30:57.310 --> 01:31:03.950
jackson: it's all self-contained and it's loaded into Quad. So, this second demo, we're gonna make something amazing with

626
01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:11.919
jackson: the business that I run, by the way, it's called Fungus Head. We sold mushroom spores, and I'm gonna say…

627
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.519
jackson: Valentine's Day is coming up. That's all I'm gonna say, and just see what it makes.

628
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.280
jackson: So basically, this skill creates on-brand.

629
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:30.570
jackson: emails for my business, using my brand voice, using my assets, using real site links, because I pulled a sitemap.

630
01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:40.280
jackson: from my website that just mapped every URL, like, real URLs, gave that to this skill so it lives in the references, so that Claude knows

631
01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.930
jackson: Alright, when inserting links, check that the link exists in the sitemap.

632
01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.859
jackson: So, all this stuff is baked in.

633
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:50.220
jackson: student skill.

634
01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:52.790
jackson: Now we're gonna get a Valentine's Day.

635
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:53.850
jackson: Email.

636
01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:59.739
jackson: And I am busy, so, like, I took on a full-time job.

637
01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:01.670
jackson: Back in November.

638
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:21.260
jackson: And I still have the business, so this is one of the few things that I still do for the business, is I create emails. And the way I create emails is this. So it's literally on Saturdays, I wake up, and it's like 5 minutes. All I have to do is, hey, make me a new email I can send to my list, because I don't want the list to go dormant.

639
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:24.630
jackson: And I know it's kind of…

640
01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:37.279
jackson: I'm just having AI write the email for me, basically, I know, but I've given it a lot of context as to what I want the brand to sort of stand for, what it, like.

641
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:45.349
jackson: has baked into it, and, like, I'm busy during the week with my day job, so I don't really have the luxury of

642
01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:51.249
jackson: writing a full email from scratch. So this just, like, removes a lot of that from my plate.

643
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.289
jackson: And it does a pretty good job. We'll see…

644
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.880
jackson: how this turns out. In the meantime, let's see if we have questions.

645
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:04.310
Ann Marie Almariei: There's one that I'm curious about, too. Lee asked.

646
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:14.860
Ann Marie Almariei: So, do you need Cloud Code Terminal to call MCP servers, or can you do that in the desktop app? Or even in, like, co-work?

647
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:21.339
Ann Marie Almariei: Do I need to have, quad code going to use an MCP server?

648
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.500
jackson: You don't.

649
01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:28.680
jackson: You do not. You can do that inside of Cloud Desktop, you can do that inside of Cloud UI,

650
01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:35.650
jackson: A little disclaimer is, like, Anthropic created… okay, let's open this in a…

651
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:43.070
jackson: Hold on. Hold, please. Not the final email. I'll get to that later. Anthropic created…

652
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.900
jackson: A lot of different ways of connecting external

653
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:52.780
jackson: resources, and it's kind of confusing, if I'm being honest. If you go to Settings.

654
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.000
jackson: And you scroll down to… so we already know what capabilities it houses.

655
01:33:58.170 --> 01:34:02.009
jackson: But then they have connectors, and connectors are essentially…

656
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.160
jackson: MCP servers, and these are all different apps that you can access.

657
01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.409
jackson: Via Claude, and it actually looks like…

658
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:17.570
jackson: In the Cloud web UI, which is where I am now, they don't have the additional

659
01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:20.119
jackson: Section below that.

660
01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:25.189
jackson: But on the desktop app, You, for sure, can use…

661
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.599
jackson: MCP servers, just like these ones.

662
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:34.100
jackson: But this is not a complete list, and even in the connectors, tab, like…

663
01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:42.899
jackson: this is not a complete list of servers that you can use. You can add your own, for sure. We can walk through that later, but for now.

664
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.009
jackson: Let's show you guys, this amazing email.

665
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.650
jackson: Email Valentine's Day.

666
01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:04.310
jackson: Alright, okay, it's a little… it's a little funky, but basically, this is, like, the… can you see this email? I guess I should see it now.

667
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:18.170
jackson: And sometimes this happens. The skill's not perfect, so I sometimes have to prompt it, hey, fix all that text, because that doesn't look good. But, like, this is sort of the format of the website. It's just the…

668
01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.760
jackson: neo-brutalist style, Kinda in your face.

669
01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:28.060
jackson: And then, look, it created a little coupon code, mice love, so now I would just take this.

670
01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:37.790
jackson: This HTML file that it made, and I'd copy it, and I'd go to the Drip UI, and I would paste it into, like, their HTML email builder.

671
01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:42.989
jackson: I'd create the coupon code in the WordPress backend that I have.

672
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.680
jackson: And I'd hit send, and boom. It's done.

673
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:52.420
jackson: And again, these are all real links, so if I click on… Build a custom bundle.

674
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.850
jackson: It takes me to the Build a Bundle page.

675
01:35:56.270 --> 01:36:01.969
jackson: So this website's built on WordPress, and I've… Really just, like, kicked myself.

676
01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:03.610
jackson: Because of that, because…

677
01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:10.690
jackson: I'd prefer if this was just completely headless, but we were so deeply ingrained into WordPress that

678
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:21.969
jackson: switching didn't make any sense, so I feel limited by what I'm able to do here, honestly, because of the fact that it's built on WordPress. I could just do a lot more, but that's just a…

679
01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:29.770
jackson: personal trite. Let's keep going. Any questions on the, email generator stuff?

680
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:36.890
jackson: are… mushrooms, aphrodisiacs. They are indeed aphrodisiacs, some of them, I believe.

681
01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.689
jackson: How is this different from setting up a brand project

682
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:47.019
jackson: to write copy. Yeah, you could set up a project, for sure, and, like, have Claude reference that.

683
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:52.139
jackson: I guess, like, skills are, like, again, they're really close to a lot of stuff where

684
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:57.400
jackson: Maybe you already have a Claude project for something that you do on a daily basis.

685
01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:04.860
jackson: My, sort of, recommendation would be go to that Claude project, and prompt Claude.

686
01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:17.249
jackson: could you turn this into a skill? Just say that, like, could you turn this project into a skill and make it even more valuable for me? I actually did that with a coworker last week, where he had a Claude project.

687
01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:28.889
jackson: to extract, like, customer personas. What it would do, it would scrape, like, comments on Facebook and all this stuff, pull data in, create these custom personas.

688
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:42.599
jackson: and then output this, like, persona file, and I went over, and we just did it together in, like, 30 minutes. We just asked Claude inside the project to turn it into a skill, and then by the end of it, he had a working skill.

689
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.250
jackson: And so now what he can do…

690
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:52.289
jackson: with that skill is he can do a number of things. He can share that skill with other people if he wants to, first and foremost.

691
01:37:52.420 --> 01:38:02.050
jackson: You can also improve that skill. So with a Claude project, you're pretty limited, because Claude is not able to directly edit its instruction or, like.

692
01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:13.910
jackson: reference files. With this skill, it can. So if you have something in your Cloud project that's, like, not correct anymore, or you want to update, you manually have to go in and update that, which…

693
01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:25.670
jackson: you can do, but it's a little cumbersome. With a skill, you can say, hey, this skill file's no… or this skill is no longer relevant in this way, could you update it? And Claude will just update it for you really fast.

694
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:38.639
jackson: give you a new skill file that you can just quickly replace the other one with, and then boom, you're good to go. And you also don't need to be inside of a Claude project to do the workflow. There is

695
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:40.910
jackson: Definitely value in having

696
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:50.690
jackson: your conversation in Cloud be a part of a broader ecosystem of conversations you've had because of the memory aspect, if you use it.

697
01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:56.090
jackson: Whereas projects are limited to the project memory, and the…

698
01:38:56.770 --> 01:39:05.750
jackson: outside of Cloud projects, when you're just regularly talking to it, it has a different memory that is based on, like, all the, kind of, past information, which…

699
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:08.679
jackson: Can or cannot be useful sometimes, obviously.

700
01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.220
jackson: Good question, though.

701
01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:16.609
jackson: Alright, this next demo is an example of…

702
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:20.589
jackson: How you'd use a skill to basically,

703
01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:28.650
jackson: I wonder if we should show this, because we are running a little behind on time.

704
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:36.890
jackson: And this is definitely a more advanced use case, unless people really want to see. Okay, go. Leon says go.

705
01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.430
jackson: Alright, we're.

706
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:44.899
Ann Marie Almariei: Maybe, maybe we show it, and, you know, not build it.

707
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.060
jackson: just… Yeah, actually, I've already run through it, so let me show you what it is.

708
01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:49.670
Ann Marie Almariei: Okay.

709
01:39:51.110 --> 01:40:01.580
jackson: So I'm gonna open up the app that everyone is either in love with or completely afraid of, Cursor, and inside of Cursor, right now we're looking at the terminal.

710
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:08.060
jackson: If I type Claude into the terminal, I have Claude installed, or Claude Code installed, I should say.

711
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:10.970
jackson: it opens up Cloud Code, okay?

712
01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:14.990
jackson: If I open up this side view, you'll see I have folders.

713
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:17.909
Ann Marie Almariei: We still see the presentation, just FYI.

714
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:18.720
jackson: Just kidding.

715
01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.600
jackson: Hold on.

716
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:22.209
jackson: Oh, please.

717
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.359
jackson: Okay, is that better?

718
01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:28.540
jackson: Yes?

719
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:32.559
jackson: Yeah, sorry, I was on mute.

720
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:37.490
jackson: Okay, let me zoom in. So, this is cursor, this is the… Shoot.

721
01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:41.329
jackson: This is the terminal with Cloud Code open.

722
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:47.609
jackson: And then in this little side view, this is basically like a folder view. So I have files.

723
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:49.770
jackson: And then I have some folders.

724
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:56.759
jackson: And so… basically, what Claude Code can see is it can see all these… all these files, right?

725
01:40:57.170 --> 01:41:04.179
jackson: The broader folder that I'm in lives on my computer, it's just called creative-variation-gen.

726
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:10.870
jackson: And so this is just a folder on my computer. I open that folder within cursor.

727
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:18.540
jackson: This cursor allows you to basically open a folder and have files and be able to edit those files, move those folders, do things with it.

728
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.559
jackson: And so that's how I use Cursor, really. And now I have Cloud Code open. So…

729
01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:27.559
jackson: What this skill does, it actually… I'll show you where it lives first.

730
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.589
jackson: So, inside of, like, outside of the Cloud desktop and the Claude web UI,

731
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:44.109
jackson: If you're doing… if you're using skills, you would typically have, like, a folder, within whatever… Project you're in.

732
01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:51.799
jackson: In this case, I'm using the skill with Claude, so there's this .clawed folder. Under that, I have a skills folder.

733
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.809
jackson: And then, if I open this skill filter, there's a skill called Add Creative Variance.

734
01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:07.150
jackson: And so, I can now… drop down, So… from skill.md up.

735
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:12.829
jackson: these are the files and folders that make up this particular skill. So there's the…

736
01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:20.870
jackson: the skill.md file, which has the name, description, and instructions.

737
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.580
jackson: And that's the main skill file, right? And then there's scripts, And there's references.

738
01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:36.929
jackson: So the skill works by basically calling Gemini's image API, Using this script.

739
01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:40.589
jackson: to generate images. So it teaches Quad

740
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:46.620
jackson: how to generate images with a pre-written script that already knows how to connect to the API.

741
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:56.130
jackson: And what I can get from it is… I give it a… Reference image N?

742
01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.320
jackson: So this would be, like, an ad.

743
01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.860
jackson: And it gives me…

744
01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:08.970
jackson: a moderate or, like, a variation of that image out. Just because I specify it in the skill, like, I want a…

745
01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:24.370
jackson: Image variation generator, because when you're running ads, typically, you'll find a winning ad, if it's a static ad or whatever, and you want to see if you can extend the life of that winning ad by generating, like, subtle variations, because maybe the

746
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:34.220
jackson: core principle of the ad just works, but you're like, can this work with other things? So I tried this on a few different references. Like, another example of the original

747
01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.269
jackson: I just pulled from the web.

748
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:42.119
jackson: And I asked, Claude Code, can you generate an image of this?

749
01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.129
jackson: Alright, can you generate a variation of this image ad? And it cooked up.

750
01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:51.559
jackson: like, a slight variant of the ad, and I can be descriptive with how

751
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:58.549
jackson: intense I want the variations to be. Let me show you just, like, what it use… or what it entails.

752
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.060
jackson: So, I am… Basically.

753
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:12.869
jackson: like, I'm calling on the skill, and this looks different from what we've done, because it's slash man, I know, but…

754
01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:24.269
jackson: skills are turning into slash commands inside of Cloud Code, but they can also be automatically invoked. This is a really advanced example, so I don't want to, like, scare anyone away. It's a lot simpler than it looks and

755
01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:26.979
jackson: It kind of is showing up right now.

756
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:29.659
jackson: But I'll just tag one of these ads.

757
01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.650
jackson: Right now, and just see what it does.

758
01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:42.389
jackson: So, basically, the long story short here is, like, if you have a skill that wants… you want to generate

759
01:44:43.890 --> 01:44:54.699
jackson: either, like, image files, video files, or anything kind of a little more advanced than, like, the markdown or the document files that you can make in Cloud Desktop or Cloud Web UI, you can

760
01:44:54.980 --> 01:45:05.979
jackson: probably do it if you just use it within, like, Cursor, Windsurf, or any of those applications. Because of the fact that this, like, folder system is embedded in these apps.

761
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:14.200
jackson: And Claude Code has more access than other, sort of, regular, Claude desktop.

762
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.980
jackson: products?

763
01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:32.859
jackson: It's a lot more effective to just do this. And I know this is probably super confusing if you've never used Cloud Code before, but basically it's the same thing. So, the skill I've made, what it does is it first defines the anatomy of the ad. So it reads the image ad I gave it.

764
01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:36.670
jackson: and says, alright, element and analysis. It's hook.

765
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:55.499
jackson: It was that chocolate bar image. It said, what's the copy, what's the CTA, the mood, the tone, some callouts. It takes all that, it synthesizes it, comes up with a plan to create some variations. Alright, we're gonna test the color. It's gonna be a cooler color palette, we're gonna test flipping the layout.

766
01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:05.770
jackson: We're gonna test a different copy angle. We're gonna test a darker premium mood. And so now it's generating the actual images. You can see it's generating the images.

767
01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:13.060
jackson: And so now, if I open up the reference, here's our reference, let me pull up…

768
01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.319
jackson: The first variation it made.

769
01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.210
jackson: So now just change the color of it a little bit.

770
01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.250
jackson: And then, similarly, let's see what it did next.

771
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:27.099
jackson: Oh, gave it some chocolate balls. I don't know if that's necessarily on brand.

772
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:34.190
jackson: This would be a use case where, hey, you specify in the skill, I don't have chocolate balls, I just sell bars, here's what they look like.

773
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:38.819
jackson: That's how you can improve this skill, this is just a random chocolate bar company I pulled.

774
01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:46.209
jackson: Variation 3… Gave it a little logo. Find it at Albertson's. Not bad.

775
01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:50.120
jackson: Curation 4… Just gave it some extra touches.

776
01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.639
jackson: I actually like that better.

777
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:58.209
jackson: So, you can see how skills can be super useful. Especially in this way.

778
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:04.189
jackson: But yeah, that's just a way more advanced example. Let's go back to the presentation really fast.

779
01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:07.160
jackson: So we are low on time.

780
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.720
jackson: I'll take, like, Should we take a question before?

781
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:17.119
Ann Marie Almariei: I was thinking maybe we should do our big announcement. Jackson, what do you think?

782
01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:20.880
jackson: Yeah, let me skim through the next part, because it is a little important.

783
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:22.070
Ann Marie Almariei: Okay.

784
01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.679
jackson: Quickly, some safety and resources.

785
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.049
jackson: You want to treat skills like software installs, so…

786
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.200
jackson: be very wary, and don't, like… I'm not saying this to freak you out, because there's definitely official, like.

787
01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:49.669
jackson: places to install skills from, like the Anthropic and OpenAI GitHub repositories have examples of really great skills. All the skills that are already in Anthropic's UI under example skills, legitimate skills, real skills.

788
01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:55.140
jackson: There are skills, however, out there that include scripts, like the one I just showed you.

789
01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:00.119
jackson: that are not helpful, and they're actually malicious. Some people will try to

790
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:11.769
jackson: Get people to install skills that have scripts in them that instruct AI to do malicious things. So just be cautious. If you're ever uncertain, you can point

791
01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:28.900
jackson: your AI or whatever at a skill file. You don't have to install it, you can literally upload the skill file as, like, an attachment into your context, and say, scan this skill file and just check it for, like, vulnerabilities and security. It will review the file.

792
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:42.920
jackson: And then tell you, alright, this looks good. Like, do you want me to install this? Whatever else. So just be aware of the fact, like, there are people out there trying to get other people to install skills that do bad things. Don't get, don't get fooled.

793
01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:50.090
jackson: They are valuable, just be careful. And the… where to find them, like, there's official repositories.

794
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:56.860
jackson: that you can find them. There's well-known, like, organizations, like Composio is one example.

795
01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:10.929
jackson: And then, like, marketplaces just use those with a little bit of caution. Like, any marketplace someone spins up, just be aware that there are some security risks. So, like, github.com slash anthropics slash skills.

796
01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:18.100
jackson: has tons of useful skills. This is GitHub. Think of it as a remote storage for folders and files.

797
01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:20.820
jackson: Under skills is where they have

798
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.439
jackson: All these folders, and you'll notice that these folders

799
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:44.920
jackson: are mostly just the skills that you saw in the Claude UI. So, like, here's the skill creator skill. You can actually click it and see what's under the hood. You got the skill.md. So this was the skill we used in Claw Desktop. They just host it open source for you to be able to, like, modify and change around.

800
01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.050
jackson: So hopefully that's helpful for people.

801
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:51.470
jackson: Now, we can get into the announcement stuff.

802
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.539
jackson: Start with one workflow, build one skill, and repeat.

803
01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:02.780
jackson: And then, if you scan the QR code, it'll take you to a page where you'll basically be walked through

804
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:16.980
jackson: three questions, and it sort of finds out some information about you, and then there's a link at the end that will, if you click it, take you to claud.ai with a prompt pre-filled, like how I was showing you earlier.

805
01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:33.990
jackson: So you can just right away start building a skill that's useful for you. So, if you scan that, click on Build Your Skill, go through those questions, it'll pre-fill a link to Claw.ai that if you just click it, opens in Claw.ai, and boom, you're ready to build a skill. It'll, like.

806
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:52.080
jackson: you'll basically start a conversation with Claude, and it will hopefully load the Skill Creator skill. If it doesn't, just make sure it's enabled in the settings. But that's pretty much it. And thank you to the ViMarketers community for this awesome, awesome opportunity to showcase the skills.

807
01:50:52.910 --> 01:51:10.350
Ann Marie Almariei: Jackson, this was amazing, and there's so many questions and things that we could go deeper into. So the big announcement is that it doesn't end here. We are going to continue this conversation in school.

808
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:21.690
Ann Marie Almariei: And we're starting something called Vibe Labs. Now, this is gonna be our first pilot of Vibe Labs. The first one will be our Skills Lab.

809
01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:41.879
Ann Marie Almariei: Where it's sort of like a sub-community within the Vibe Marketer community, where people come together around a certain topic. So, skills is all the rage right now. Everybody's trying to figure out how to use them. And in looking at the data from everybody coming to this session today.

810
01:51:41.880 --> 01:52:02.289
Ann Marie Almariei: We were just amazed at how many people are using Claude already, but haven't, you know, even started using skills. So we want to help you level up, we want to help you start using skills right away. So as of right now, I'm clicking the post button immediately.

811
01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:07.470
Ann Marie Almariei: I have just posted in school, a new…

812
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:25.659
Ann Marie Almariei: Skills Lab channel, and in that channel, we are going to have active conversations about building these skills. If you have questions from this session that we weren't able to answer, please jump in there, and ask them, of Jackson.

813
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:49.990
Ann Marie Almariei: And we're gonna be doing more live sessions. So Jackson, is one of the first mentors within our community that has agreed to do a monthly, skills, lab, where we build together. So he'll be jumping into that channel in school, and, you know, we can, we can keep this going.

814
01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:58.600
Ann Marie Almariei: Because we could easily spend another 2 hours here just talking about, you know, very basic stuff. And we also have…

815
01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:14.850
Ann Marie Almariei: Adam Sandler, not the comedian, but our Claude Code mentor, who's been doing, mentor sessions around how to get Claude Code set up. It's a little bit more advanced, so we wanted to, like, round it out. We wanted to make sure that we get the basics

816
01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:37.690
Ann Marie Almariei: covered, as well as the advanced covered. So, you know, for those of you that were asking, you know, how do you automate some of this, and how do you invoke skills through agents and sub-agents, and, you know, that, I think, is another topic for another day. But, you know, we're all in. Like, we want to make sure that everybody is armed with

817
01:53:37.690 --> 01:53:48.590
Ann Marie Almariei: as much insight and information to build, as possible. And Jackson, you've given us a lot of really amazing stuff to start out with here.

818
01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:55.570
Ann Marie Almariei: Any… anybody have any questions? You know, Jackson, do you have a few minutes so we can open it up and see if anybody.

819
01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:59.520
jackson: Yeah, it felt like 15 minutes, I could stay on and answer some questions.

820
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:02.100
Ann Marie Almariei: Alright, yeah, let's do… let's do a couple questions.

821
01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:03.760
jackson: Cool.

822
01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:07.240
Ann Marie Almariei: Anybody, want to raise, raise their hand, come up on stage?

823
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:14.150
Ann Marie Almariei: Nobody?

824
01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:20.459
Ann Marie Almariei: All right. Well then, that just means y'all are ready to go. All right.

825
01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.139
jackson: I got one.

826
01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.339
Ann Marie Almariei: Jesse, go ahead.

827
01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:25.299
Jesse: I gotcha, I gotcha.

828
01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:31.459
Jesse: I am interested in chaining the skills together, so I've played around with skills a bunch, but

829
01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:35.909
Jesse: But I haven't chained them together a ton, so I'm wondering whether you can,

830
01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.150
Jesse: I don't know, hit that a little bit for…

831
01:54:39.150 --> 01:54:39.590
jackson: Yeah.

832
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:41.600
Jesse: Just tell us more about chaining. Thank you.

833
01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.990
jackson: So, if you're training skills together, the first thing you have to be aware of is that

834
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:53.319
jackson: Claude, or whatever you're using skills with, has to have the context that it has those multiple skills.

835
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:59.869
jackson: And so, typically, what you might do is you might have, say, two individual skills right now.

836
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.450
jackson: One of them will pull personas.

837
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:11.590
jackson: And then one of them will generate video scripts based on the personas, but the video script skill might not know

838
01:55:11.730 --> 01:55:18.109
jackson: that the persona skill exists, and vice versa. So what you could do is…

839
01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:21.280
jackson: Imagine you're in the Claw desktop app.

840
01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.170
jackson: And both of those skills are enabled.

841
01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:26.679
jackson: you can prompt Claude and say.

842
01:55:27.490 --> 01:55:43.400
jackson: modify my Persona extractor skill so that it references my video script skill, so that whenever the personas are extracted, it immediately goes and does the next step, which is generate the

843
01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:50.339
jackson: video scripts. And so, every time that you would run the persona generator, it'd automatically invoke

844
01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:59.449
jackson: the video script skill following, like, completion, or whenever you tell it to in the prompt, or sorry, the persona extractor skill.

845
01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.419
jackson: So that's, like, one use case.

846
01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:08.719
jackson: That you could, use if you have two existing skills that are already made. Yeah?

847
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:22.119
Jesse: So… you're keeping that in context, is that correct? So it's like, when you're invoking the skill, and it's gonna invoke the next skill, you're keeping that in your context window? Is that accurate?

848
01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.359
jackson: Yeah, depend… I would. If you're… depending on, like.

849
01:56:27.010 --> 01:56:29.039
jackson: I guess that would be an example of…

850
01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.000
jackson: Just going through a workflow, where you actually

851
01:56:33.250 --> 01:56:36.509
jackson: Might run into those limits with the context window.

852
01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:44.910
jackson: But, you might have another example of where you just might invoke two skills from the get-go, or…

853
01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.510
jackson: like, what is your… I guess, what's your use case? Do you have, like, a specific example?

854
01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.550
Jesse: Well, so, I mean, I guess…

855
01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:56.059
Jesse: To keep it abstract for just one more minute,

856
01:56:56.470 --> 01:57:02.060
Jesse: Are you, like, would you have it output something in a folder, and then have the next skill

857
01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:06.250
Jesse: That you're calling… call something from that output folder.

858
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.169
Jesse: Like, it's gonna look in a specific outlook? Yeah, go ahead.

859
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:10.629
jackson: You control.

860
01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:24.130
Jesse: Okay, so, yeah, so I guess, use case, Tom on the, on the call had something where he was like, I do a bunch of work, and then it outputs, yeah, it's an excellent skill. I took a look. And it outputs,

861
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:31.309
Jesse: like, social media posts, right? So, personally, I don't enjoy posting on social media, and…

862
01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:47.790
Jesse: I don't want to do it, so… but I work a lot, right? And I would love to take my work, and I would love to post that on social media, and whatever, build in public, or brand, personal brand, etc. So, that would be an example of chaining skills together. Like, I need to take my work, summarize it.

863
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:53.270
Jesse: make it pithy, put it in my voice, generate an image, Tom had some music in there.

864
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:54.510
Jesse: Stuff like that.

865
01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:06.479
jackson: Yeah, yeah, I can share a real example that I use. I have, like, a weekly review skill that I've uploaded into Quad.

866
01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:11.999
jackson: And so, like, Sundays, I'll say, use the weekly review skill, and let's recap the week.

867
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:17.570
jackson: There's a lot of different things that happen, but one of the things that happens is it…

868
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:23.519
jackson: it's also connected to my Apple Notes. So, like, the skill I made in Claude

869
01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:38.250
jackson: knows to reference Apple Notes, because I keep a ton of information in notes that are, like, things I'm building, things I'm doing, so the skill would go read the, like, last 7 days worth of notes.

870
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:45.060
jackson: And then… First, it helped me just synthesize what happened and, like, you know, surface insights.

871
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:56.229
jackson: But then I can also… haven't set it up yet, but what I'm gonna do is have it extract, like, the high signal stuff, so the things that were worth sharing.

872
01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:05.529
jackson: I'm gonna have, like, as a separate skill, so that every time I run weekly review, it skims the notes from my last week.

873
01:59:05.590 --> 01:59:19.119
jackson: surfaces Insights, and then once it has, like, that part finished, we'll run the signal surfacing skill, or whatever I call it, to then surface things that are highly relevant for, like.

874
01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:27.560
jackson: the audience that I'm maybe trying to build, and, like, surface those, say, hey, you should maybe consider sharing this, this, this, or this.

875
01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.510
jackson: You know, based on this.

876
01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:37.370
jackson: That's, like, one example that I am currently, like, implementing into my own workflow, so I don't know if that helps.

877
01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:40.140
jackson: But yeah, like, you could… Shane, go ahead.

878
01:59:40.410 --> 01:59:46.660
Jesse: Yeah, I'm just curious about the mechanics right there, right? So, like, that's a fantastic example, and so are you…

879
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:52.850
Jesse: Where are you taking… You have your synthesis of your notes, let's say.

880
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:54.809
Jesse: Where is that going?

881
01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:58.030
Jesse: And then, where is your next skill?

882
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:59.450
Jesse: Looking for it.

883
02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:07.829
jackson: So, I just open a chat in Claude desktop app. I say, let's run the weekly review.

884
02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:11.000
jackson: It invokes the weekly review skill.

885
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:22.559
jackson: And then it immediately goes through my notes, because in the weekly review instruction, I have it instructed to call on the Apple Notes MCP server to go read through

886
02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.469
jackson: my past notes.

887
02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:33.159
jackson: It does that, and now has all my notes loaded into the context window, and then once it surfaces the insights for me, then it runs

888
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:37.849
jackson: Signal surfacing skill to then extract the same

889
02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:45.160
jackson: like, it's using the same bank of notes, but now it's surfacing different things. Because the first part is, like, just help me

890
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:56.159
jackson: recap the week, like, what did I accomplish? What did I do? Where am I struggling? Then it goes into, by the way, you know, you can also write about these things for next week to share with people.

891
02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:02.190
jackson: It just requires you to, like, have a… I guess, a way to…

892
02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:12.439
jackson: dump your context, I guess, on, like, a consistent basis. For me, I open Apple Notes, and I use Whisperflow, and I'll, like, walk… I'll go on walks.

893
02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:18.059
jackson: And I'll just be just, like, talking to my phone, looking like a crazy person, but I'll do that for, like.

894
02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:35.450
jackson: 15 minutes, and then I'll come back, and I have this, like, huge text that is just recapping whatever is on my mind, whatever I did, etc, that at the end of the week, Claude just reads through all of that, and is like, huh, you know, and then it's, like, surfacing insights, and then it's like.

895
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:44.670
jackson: you talked about building this thing on Saturday or Thursday, like, super cool, we should share that. So, that's how I'm doing it. Hopefully that helps with your workflow.

896
02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:51.750
Tom Lyons: But you're putting all, like, you're putting those instructions in the skill.md file, Like, like…

897
02:01:52.090 --> 02:02:10.370
Tom Lyons: that's how it's getting that context, because it looks at that skill MD file, and then goes, oh, okay, so I'm supposed to pull this other skill to do this. I'm supposed to pull this other skill to do this, or a sub-skill, or however it's put together in your folder, your skill folder.

898
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:14.050
jackson: Yeah, pretty much. The instructions are…

899
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:18.509
jackson: First, gather the contacts from notes.

900
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:28.410
jackson: then it's Surface Insights, then it's run this skill, and then so long as that other skill is enabled and in the context window, it's like, oh.

901
02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:32.559
jackson: Alright, now I'm running this skill, and then it goes on and does the next thing, I guess. Yeah.

902
02:02:32.710 --> 02:02:45.580
Tom Lyons: Yeah. Yeah, Jesse, my skill is, like, really similar to that. I'm just calling different tools in a different process, right? So, mine is watch what I'm doing during the day, and then as I'm doing that post

903
02:02:45.580 --> 02:03:01.160
Tom Lyons: notes to my pocket-based database, right? Then when I call the skill directly, I want you to go pull all that back out, find some good stuff, then use the copywriting skill, then use the scriptwriting skill. Like, it's… it's… once…

904
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:07.620
Tom Lyons: Once you start understanding it's just defining a workflow in a skill, it starts to get really cool.

905
02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:21.729
jackson: I think it starts with your workflow. Like, your context gathering phase is having it basically just, like, watch what you're doing and automatically upload those notes. Mine is, I'll just go talk into my phone, and it's like, find what you can use

906
02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:32.070
jackson: To, like, gather the context that you want it to leverage, find that workflow, and then maybe, yeah, just create that skill chain around your workflow.

907
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:34.410
jackson: Skill chain, that's a really cool phrase.

908
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:55.510
Ann Marie Almariei: this feels a lot like what I expect our, our first labs, session to… to be like. We'll all be… just be here jamming on ideas and building stuff. Jackson, do you have any thoughts on, like, what our… what our, our lab session might… might be like?

909
02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:01.520
jackson: I think I'm… I think I'll put out some feelers into that channel that's now created.

910
02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:03.739
jackson: And maybe poll to see, like.

911
02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:11.630
jackson: What use cases we might want to explore, and maybe how technical we want to get, and then whatever just has, like, the…

912
02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:13.989
jackson: Highest demand start there, maybe.

913
02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:29.420
jackson: Amazing. But it sounds like people are, yeah, people are using skills and already have these really cool workflows, so definitely want to include, like, some showcases, if possible somehow, but there's just so much to explore.

914
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:48.329
Ann Marie Almariei: Well, we're here for it. Jackson, thank you again so much for this session. I'll ask you one last question, because I saw the question come up probably 5 times throughout the presentation. Did you use a skill to view this presentation?

915
02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:52.290
jackson: Yes, I did, I used two skills.

916
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:53.660
Léon Dantuma: Thank you so much, Anna.

917
02:04:54.490 --> 02:04:56.020
Ann Marie Almariei: Of course, happy to do it.

918
02:04:57.150 --> 02:04:58.810
Léon Dantuma: Would you be willing to share it?

919
02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:02.120
jackson: The skills to create this presentation?

920
02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.909
Léon Dantuma: Oh, man, I'm in love with that presentation. It's so clear and crisp.

921
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:15.899
jackson: Listen, so I'll show you, like, my workflow, what I did. I started with the basic PowerPoint skill from Anthropic. That's an example skill they have.

922
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:34.240
jackson: didn't like it. I was like, this isn't what I'm looking for here. Then I went to their connector, to this, like, AI slideshow generator that they have, another MCP server. Didn't like that. What I ended up doing is, I have a brand voice skill, and I have a front-end design skill.

923
02:05:34.770 --> 02:05:37.310
jackson: that I used to create the website.

924
02:05:37.570 --> 02:05:44.690
jackson: that you get linked to from the QR code. I didn't even have a presentation skill. I just said, use my brand voice

925
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:46.600
jackson: And front-end design skill.

926
02:05:46.710 --> 02:05:49.599
jackson: And create me a presentation based on that.

927
02:05:49.780 --> 02:06:06.219
jackson: And so it took those… the context from those skills. The skills don't actually need to be even related to what you want it to do. Like, I didn't have a presentation skill, I just had a skill to define my voice, and a skill to define my…

928
02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:14.909
jackson: preferred aesthetic. And then it created a presentation, because I prompted after that, I said, make me a presentation, here's the outline.

929
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:16.850
jackson: And it was one prompt.

930
02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:23.139
jackson: I said, make me the presentation, use these two skills, here's the outline, and then boom, I had this

931
02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:41.539
jackson: like, 30-slide deck. It was just a single HTML file with all the styles already included. It used HTML likely because it was, like, a front-end design skill, and it just knew how to write HTML, but that's how I did it. If I shared the two skills I used, you would get

932
02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:50.030
jackson: not probably the same output. It's… it's also dependent upon the prompt that you include with the skill.

933
02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:55.159
jackson: So, like, you can still guide it to do specific things. I could have said, probably.

934
02:06:55.380 --> 02:07:02.219
jackson: Use these two skills, And make me a… I don't know, like,

935
02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:07.700
jackson: something different. It didn't have to be a presentation, and it probably would have done something different, but that's…

936
02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:09.120
jackson: Kind of how I built it.

937
02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:23.369
Léon Dantuma: Yeah, okay, thanks, that's really clear. What I'm struggling with a bit is that I find it hard to get from a visual, so I see, like, a nice design, and then I want to translate that and feed it into a skill.

938
02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:31.679
Léon Dantuma: So, how do you process visual information so that it goes to the level that it can create HTML or things like that?

939
02:07:31.890 --> 02:07:34.610
Léon Dantuma: Like, for instance, also for your brand voice.

940
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:35.880
jackson: Yeah.

941
02:07:36.230 --> 02:07:42.740
jackson: It's definitely a lot of just back and forth and tinkering, which I'm sure you've already done, but…

942
02:07:43.150 --> 02:07:48.320
jackson: I like to… I like to dump sometimes, so I'll just, like.

943
02:07:48.650 --> 02:07:52.219
jackson: transcribe what I say so that I can get a lot out.

944
02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:57.090
jackson: And then it'll build something for me. Like, it had a front-end design skill that it made.

945
02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:59.819
jackson: that was the first draft that I was like.

946
02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:10.919
jackson: I don't really like this. I think I went through probably 3 or 4 refinements before I got to something I liked, and I'm still refining the front-end design skill, so…

947
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:23.479
jackson: Like, I'm seeing things where, like, small things now. I got it mostly there. I gave it, like, the broader direction of where to go, and then once we were there, I just then slowly refined.

948
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:29.550
jackson: And I also suggest, Leon, to start with the front-end design skill from Anthropic.

949
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:33.420
jackson: I believe I actually started there, too. So take that front-end design skill.

950
02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:38.599
jackson: load it into Claude and say, I want to make my own front-end design

951
02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:48.730
jackson: style, because that one that you can get from Anthropic has 4 styles, I believe, already baked into it, but you can take that skill and say.

952
02:08:48.740 --> 02:09:01.819
jackson: cut all the extra fluff out. I want my design to mostly look like this particular one, but let's… let's modify it and make it my own, kind of thing. Because that front-end design skill is really well crafted already, so just take that one and…

953
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:12.210
jackson: and remix that one. There was a section I had on remixing skills, which I… we didn't get to cover, but so valuable is to take another skill that already does a thing.

954
02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:19.469
jackson: and then feed that to Claude and say, build me a skill that does X. Like, this is how I built the…

955
02:09:20.010 --> 02:09:26.739
jackson: image variation generator. I just took another skill that generated images, and said, alright, now let's…

956
02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:39.929
jackson: let's niche down on this skill and just have it produce variations of winning ads. And so the framework was already there, all I had to do was just kind of give it a little more guidance. That's how I build the front-end design skill, and I recommend you do that, too.

957
02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.879
Léon Dantuma: Oh, that's really helpful, thanks.

958
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:45.339
jackson: Yeah, I probably should have led with that. Just remixed the other people's skills.

959
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.129
Ann Marie Almariei: Can I ask… Alright, guys.

960
02:09:49.130 --> 02:10:06.939
Ann Marie Almariei: We've got to… we've gotta shut it down, just because we're keeping the whole team here, but please jump into school, ask any other questions that you have there in the Labs channel. Thanks, everybody. This has been such a great session. Thank you, Jackson. See y'all soon.

961
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:09.460
jackson: Sweet. Thank you guys. Bye.

962
02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.280
Ann Marie Almariei: Bye-bye.
