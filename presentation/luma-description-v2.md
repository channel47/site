🎟 Mentor Session Alert!

Everyone's talking about AI agents and automation, but most marketers still don't know how to actually extend what Claude can do. Skills are the missing piece, and they're simpler than you think (just folders with files, no code required).

In this mentor session, Jackson Dean, performance marketer at 4AM Media, walks through the entire AI capability ecosystem and shows you exactly how to build custom skills that fit your workflow.

[CHANGED: removed "90-minute", removed "find, install, and" — session focuses on understanding + building, not installation walkthroughs]

This is a hands-on, practical walkthrough. Jackson starts by mapping where skills fit in the broader ecosystem, then breaks down what skills actually are under the hood. From there, he builds a skill live with the audience, then runs three live demos of real workflows he uses every week.

[CHANGED: "two live demos" → "builds a skill live with the audience, then runs three live demos" — matches actual revised flow where building comes before demos, and there are 3 demos not 2]

🧑‍💻 Who should join?

- Growth marketers looking to automate campaign workflows without writing code
- Product managers exploring how to extend AI capabilities for their teams
- Anyone using Claude who wants to move beyond basic prompting
- Marketers tired of repetitive creative and strategy tasks

📚 What you'll learn:

- How the AI capability ecosystem works (MCP, sub-agents, skills) and when to use each
- What skills actually are under the hood and why they don't require code
- How to build your own custom skills with Claude — we'll build one live, together
- How to turn a landing page URL into a full campaign brief automatically
- How to generate on-brand marketing emails from a single sentence
- How to generate fresh ad creative variations from your existing winners

[CHANGED: removed "slash commands" from ecosystem bullet (old pattern, barely mentioned in talk), removed "find, enable, and add skills" bullet (not a focus), added "we'll build one live, together" to the building bullet, added branded email demo bullet which was missing]

⏳ Session Flow
This session is designed so you can follow it end to end or jump straight to the parts that matter most to you.

The Ecosystem ⏱️ 0:00 – 0:10 | MCP, sub-agents, skills. Different tools, different jobs.

What Skills Are ⏱️ 0:10 – 0:25 | The SKILL.md format. How skills load. Why the description makes or breaks it.

Building a Skill (Live) ⏱️ 0:25 – 0:40 | Audience picks a workflow. Claude writes the instructions. We test it. No code.

Live Demos ⏱️ 0:40 – 1:05 | Three real workflows from Jackson's day job and side projects:
01 / Google Search Campaign Architect — landing page URL in, full campaign out
02 / Branded HTML Email Generator — one sentence in, on-brand email out
03 / Ad Creative Refresher — winning ad in, fresh variations out (via Nano Banana Pro)

Safety + Resources ⏱️ 1:05 – 1:10 | Where to find trusted skills. What to check before you install.

Your Takeaway ⏱️ 1:10 – 1:15 | Start with one workflow. Build one skill. Repeat.

Q&A ⏱️ 1:15+ | Open questions from audience

[CHANGED: completely updated session flow —
  1. Building now comes BEFORE demos (revised order from dry runs)
  2. Three demos instead of two (added branded email generator)
  3. Each demo gets a one-line description
  4. Timings adjusted to match actual deck (~75 min + Q&A)
  5. Removed "We'll make every effort to stay on schedule!" fluff]

You'll leave with a guided walkthrough to build your first skill right after the session, plus the knowledge to keep building your own.

[CHANGED: replaced "two ready-to-use skills you can install immediately" — the actual takeaway is a QR-code guided walkthrough to build your first skill, not pre-made skills to install]

ℹ️ **About Our Mentor:** Jackson Dean works at 4AM Media, a performance marketing agency, where he runs paid search and shopping campaigns on Google. He builds custom skills, MCP servers, and automation workflows for advertising platforms. Most of what he knows about skills came from building them daily since they launched in October, not from reading about them.

[CHANGED: tightened bio — removed vague "deep expertise" and "years developing" claims, added specificity about what he actually does (paid search/shopping on Google), added "since they launched in October" for honesty about the timeline]
