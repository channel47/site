Set out to build a Bing Ads skill this week. Had it working in a day, launched campaigns across 5 products without touching the UI. Then I tried to make it handle API connections too and it completely fell apart in Cowork.

Spent the rest of the day building a Bing Ads MCP server instead. Turns out skills and MCPs have very different jobs and I was trying to make one do both. The plugin is better for it.

Anyone else building Claude plugins running into this? Where do you draw the line between what goes in a skill vs what belongs in an MCP?
